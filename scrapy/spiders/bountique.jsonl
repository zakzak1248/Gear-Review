The ARP ODYSSEY synthesizer, perfectly reproduced in software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the birth of the ARP Odyssey in 1972, it has been a renowned analog synthesizer used on many artists’ records. However, for a number of years it was quite difficult to come by.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, KORG reproduced the ARP ODYSSEY. This unit was designed with ARP Instruments’ co-founder David Friend as the advisor. It has received accolades for accurately recreating the much sought-after sound of the original ARP Odyssey. Based on this reproduction model, we completely recreated the ARP ODYSSEY in​ software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The circuitry has been reproduced using KORG's proprietary CMT (Component Modeling Technology), developed over the years for the KORG Legacy Collection. Instead of merely simulating the output sound as conventional modeling does, KORG’s CMT is a method for using digital equivalents of the transistors, capacitors, resistors, and other components used in the hardware realm to reconstruct the same signal path digitally. This perfectly reproduces the complex range of sounds and parameters that can only be created with the ARP ODYSSEY.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>New Functions to Create Arp Sounds That Have Never Been Heard Before</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not content with merely reproducing the hardware, the KORG Collection ARP ODYSSEY adds numerous improvements that are possible only in software. In addition to the three filter revisions and the DRIVE function that were added in KORG's hardware ARP ODYSSEY reproduction, we have added a new polyphonic voice mode that allows you to play up to 16 notes at once, an arpeggiator that can be programmed like a step sequencer, and effects that can transform the sound in diverse ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35757/original_6f4fe2b996e541723462a0dcbda05c66_pc.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 481px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>200 Presets That Make All Kinds of Things Possible</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The KORG Collection ARP ODYSSEY comes with 200 presets installed. It’s a practical and inspirational treasure box of sounds that includes ARP ODYSSEY’s biggest selling points: sharp leads, fat basses, freely roaming sequences, and patches from famous songs. Sounds you like can be saved in Favorite for quick access later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35758/original_892816936e20f86c6cc473d1180e0612_pc.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 481px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>All Three Generation Designs Available as Skins</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The software allowed sound variation expansions, but visual as well. The KORG Collection ARP ODYSSEY can instantly switch between three ARP Odyssey designs that were different depending on the production period. In addition to the standard Rev3 design with orange writing on a black panel, there is also the Rev1 with a white panel and the Rev2 with golden writing on a black panel as well.

It had the subtlety for jazz at the hands of artists like Jimmy Smith, Joey Defrancesco and John Medeski. It had the grace for gospel, as demonstrated by Elbernita “Twinkie” Clark and Cory Henry. It had the energy to drive the reggae behind the likes of Bob Marley and Jimmy Cliff, and the soul of James Brown and Sly Stone. Most visibly, it had the raw power to hold its own in a rock world as diverse as ELP, Santana, Yes, Pink Floyd, Deep Purple, The Allman Brothers, and Blood, Sweet and Tears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you’re playing solo, in a group, or in a mix, Arturia’s B-3 V lets you cover the organ parts for any genre using the sound and feel of the real thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/5010/content_b-3v-02-pluginboutique.jpg\" style=\"height:366px; width:800px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Unmatched Authenticity</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if you already have a virtual tonewheel organ… you owe it to yourself to try the B-3 V.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are organs and there are B3s. Then there are B3 emulations and Arturia’s B-3 V. Where most other attempts are based on samples that only capture some of the qualities, we created the B-3V using the same critically acclaimed modeling technology that distinguishes our entire V Collection of classic instruments.

We also included a classic “twin” guitar amp too, but why stop there? We’ve also included a whole host of gorgeously modelled effects for you to recreate those classic combinations, as well as a jaw-dropping convolution reverb to place your organ in real acoustic spaces, or process them with vintage reverb.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because this instrument is brought to life in your computer with modelling, you’re even able to modify previously fixed analog circuit features like key click. Our most radical enhancement is the addition of a modulation section to automate the movement of drawbars using envelopes, LFOs and step sequencers, letting you infuse your music with new animated textures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With its combination of faithful realism and new mods, the B-3 V has you covered whether you’re playing standards, rocking classics or pioneering new musical ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A new lease of life</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We didn't just make a software clone, we added loads of powerful, exciting new features too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With its combination of faithful realism and new mods, the B-3 V has you covered whether you’re playing standards, rocking classics or pioneering new musical ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Physical Modeling Engine (no samples)</li>\r\n\t<li>Dual manual Interface</li>\r\n\t<li>Each manual has separate MIDI channel preferences</li>\r\n\t<li>9 Drawbars per manual</li>\r\n\t<li>3 modeled chorus and vibrato settings</li>\r\n\t<li>Separate upper and lower ON/OFF</li>\r\n\t<li>Preamp drive</li>\r\n\t<li>Modeled rotary speaker emulator</li>\r\n\t<li>Advanced controls for adjusting the model</li>\r\n\t<li>Convolution based Reverb</li>\r\n\t<li>Traditional Leslie performance controls</li>\r\n\t<li>Swell pedal</li>\r\n\t<li>Percussion controls\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>On/off</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Volume soft/normal</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Slow/Fast decay</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Harmonic selection</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Output effects where you can change the order\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Volume, wah, auto-wah</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Flanger</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Compressor</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Chorus</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Analog Delay</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>New Advanced Drawbar modulators\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>LFO’s with multiple waveforms and phase</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Multipoint envelopes</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Step sequencer</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Drawbar destinations with positive and negative amount controls</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Physical model engine parameters\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Drawbar leakage</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Tonewheel leakage</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Brilliance</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Background noise</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Polyphonic Percussion</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Key click volume</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Attack and release controls</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>86 factory presets</li>\r\n\t<li>Easy to use MIDI mapping</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Arturia Software Center</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ASC is the central software that elegantly manages all your Arturia software licenses.

{"title": "BA-1", "brand": "Baby Audio", "url": "/product/1-Instruments/4-Synth/10497-BA-1", "rating": 5.0, "description": "<div itemprop=\"description\"><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34407/content_p.png\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 145px;\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">A Synth With A Soul</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>BA-1 is Baby Audio's modern re-imagination of a cultish 1982 analogue synth that looked like a toy but sounded like a beast. It brings you pure and authentic textures that are fast to program and dripping with colour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34412/original_BA-1_Baby_Audio_wav.gif\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Legacy</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>BA-1 is based on a portable 1980s synth with a toylike appearance and a gritty sound. Despite its small size, it left a big mark on music history, while still flying somewhat under the hype radar. The original has been used as a secret weapon for bubbly synth textures by some of Sweden’s most successful pop producers of the past two decades. It was also a staple of 1990s digital dancehall and beloved by the indietronica scene for its raw lo-fi quality. The ‘CS01’ - as the original is called - has never been properly captured in software form. So for Baby Audio's first-ever synth, they started there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34413/original_BA-1_Baby_Audio_battery.gif\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Sound</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In keeping with Baby Audio's motto ”It’s an evolution, not an emulation”, they modelled the hardware with the greatest possible accuracy, before carefully upgrading it with new and useful features. A second analogue-modelled oscillator, FM, polyphony, and more, help to vastly expand the sonic palette of the original. All while keeping it's signature sound unspoiled. Additionally, BA-1 lets you drain the battery, bend the circuits, and use the built-in speaker – for an authentic lo-fi aesthetic that you could normally only get with hardware.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34414/original_BA-1_Baby_Audio_fx.gif\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Effects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you know Baby Audio, you’ll know that effects are their speciality. So they've treated BA-1 with an FX section worthy of its own plugin. The effects chain is inspired by budget 1980s rack hardware and captures the lo-fi charm of the home studio scene of the era. The overdrive is modelled after a guitar pedal, while the delay, reverb and chorus effects are based on cheap, but amazing, digital rack units. In BA-1, the effects are not an afterthought but an ingrained part of the sonic signature. So tweak, use, and abuse them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34415/original_BA-1_Baby_Audio_dial.gif\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Simplicity</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>BA-1 is simple but surprisingly tweakable. Baby Audio have put great effort into tuning all parameters to be in the perfect sweet spot. This results in a rewarding programming workflow where tweaking BA-1 is a lot of fun and you’ll create new patches on repeat. And if a simple interface is not fast enough, you can always use the smart ‘Re-Gen’ feature. Hit Re-Gen and BA-1 will automatically create new and musically tuned patches with every click.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>4 Color Options - </strong>After long hours in the studio it can be nice to see something new. BA-1 lets you switch between grey, blue, purple and orange colour modes to keep things fresh. Click right here on the coloured squares to preview the options.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>500+ High-Quality Presets</strong> - BA-1 comes with a ton of new musical inspiration in the form of 500+ carefully crafted presets. This includes 4 genre-based expansion packs created by some of Baby Audio's favourite sound designers. Whether you’re into synth-wave, modern pop, lo-fi hip hop or 80s / 90s nostalgia, Baby Audio has got you covered.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Oscillator Section - </strong>The sound generators are the heart and soul of BA-1. Meticulously modelled to offer the raw grit and drift that made the original hardware so beloved. The triangle and PWM waveforms are particular highlights if</li>\r\n\t<li>you want a classic 80s dub sound. A second oscillator has been added in BA-1 - compared to the original - for more flexible sound design options.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>FM - </strong>FM adds complexity and depth to the classic analogue subtractive architecture, giving you more sound design options. Dial in the FM - oscillator either an octave above or below Oscillator 1 to add some plasticky 80s texture.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Filter Section - </strong>Analog-modeled and nicely rounded 24dB low-pass filter. The resonance offers a gritty bite and will start to self-oscillate when pushed towards the 95-100% range – just like the real hardware.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Envelope Section - </strong>The envelope lets you shape the sound with the same quirky side effects as in the original hardware. Additionally, Baby Audio has added the option to host-sync the attack time to your DAW’s BPM. This allows for sweeping sounds that rise in perfect sync with your music.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Settings - </strong>Switch between Mono and Poly mode (the original hardware was Mono only). Turn Velocity Sensitivity on or off. Open the Midi Settings. Or reset BA-1 to its initial state.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>LFO Section - </strong>A simple LFO that is easy to utilize and hard to mess up – like the original. Baby Audio have added the possibility to sync the LFO to the host BPM for more modern applications. Furthermore, the LFO section hides one of BA-1’s many easter eggs: Click the “Target” label to find it.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Sidechain - </strong>Synths sound better when they ‘move with the mix’. That’s what the Sidechain feature is for. It can work in ‘External’ or ‘Internal’ mode. By default, Sidechain is set to ‘Internal’ and will create an automatic 4/4 ducking pattern synced to your host tempo. This can be dialled in to taste. Click the ‘Routing’ label to switch to ‘External’ mode and duck BA-1 when a sidechain input is present. Place the sidechain either before or after the FX section by clicking the routing switch.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Tone + Drive - </strong>BA-1’s FX section would be worthy of its own retro-colour plugin. It is inspired by cheap 1980s rack effects and guitar pedals. ‘Tone’ offers two shelving filters to easily make BA-1’s character darker or brighter. ‘Drive’ adds gritty analogue-modelled distortion and has two modes: ‘Circuit’ models the effect of circuit bending the original hardware, while ‘OD’ models an 80s overdrive pedal.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Delay + Reverb + Chorus - </strong>The grainy digital delay, reverb and chorus combo is THE sound of the 1980s! Baby Audio has recreated this epic FX combo in BA-1 – modelled after budget rack hardware from the era. Engage all three effects at once and you’ll have a hard time programming a dull-sounding patch.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Battery - </strong>The original synth could be powered by batteries. But they never lasted long – and weird sonic artefacts were introduced as the power deteriorated. Baby Audio modelled this behaviour and exaggerated it slightly for a better effect. Drain the battery to achieve pitch fluctuations, noise and distortion the further down you go.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Speaker - </strong>Sometimes a mix needs some ‘moving air’ to come alive. While the original hardware’s speaker was by no means high quality, it had a quirky and pleasant lo-fi vibe. Baby Audio modelled it in all its rough glory. When using BA-1, you can click the speaker button to switch from line to speaker output.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Re-Gen - </strong>Creates new and unique patches with every click. Unlike a regular randomizer, Re-Gen hosts a smart algorithm, calibrated to come up with usable and musical presets on the fly. When you’re stuck for inspiration, click Re-Gen and let it take you in a new direction.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Resize - </strong>BA-1’s plugin window can be fully resized.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>TL;DR:</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The first proper analogue-modelled emulation of the CS01, a beloved and cultish 1982 monosynth</li>\r\n\t<li>Vastly expands the sonic palette of the original -thanks to careful upgrades and new features</li>\r\n\t<li>Includes a colourful FX section inspired by budget 1980s hardware</li>\r\n\t<li>Fun and easy to program, yet surprisingly versatile</li>\r\n\t<li>500+ high-quality presets and a Re-Gen function for instantly generating new patches</li>\r\n\t<li>If you want authentic, lofi-leaning, synth textures in a plugin, this is it!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>System Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>macOS:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>macOS 10.7 and up <strong>(including Catalina &amp; Big Sur)</strong>.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Plugin Formats: </strong>VST, VST3, AU, AAX</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>DAW's Supported: </strong>Ableton Live, Pro Tools, Logic Pro, FL Studio, Cubase, Nuendo, Reaper, Reason + more.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Compatibility: </strong>64-bit compatible only. Natively compatible with Apple Silicon.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Windows:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Windows 7 and up.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Plugin formats: </strong>VST, VST3, AAX</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>DAWs supported: </strong>Ableton Live, Pro Tools, Logic Pro, FL Studio, Cubase, Nuendo, Reaper, Reason + more.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Compatibility: </strong>64-bit and 32-bit compatible.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Please Note: </strong>An internet connection is required to authorise this software.</p>\r\n</div>"}

Harnessing BLEASS' signature GUI technology, creating and crafting sounds in Omega is not just easier than with other FM synths, it's easy - PERIOD!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Al of the classic capabilities of FM Synthesis is available in BLEASS Omega - expressive electric pianos, deep thundering basses, crystal-clear pads, sparkling bells, and soulful leads. And thanks to the instrument’s analogue-style Waveshaper and multi-mode Filter, BLEASS Omega can inject powerful analogue-like flavour into those pure FM tones, giving searing filter sweeps, growling distortions, and harmonically-rich resonances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The four FM operators that sit at the heart of BLEASS Omega are edited simultaneously from within a single screen, with all operator envelopes and controls available to the touch of your finger or click of your mouse. This amazingly user-friendly approach makes light work of sound editing and encourages experimentation and exploration in a way no other FM synth can achieve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With eleven FM algorithms on offer, each providing a different way of interconnecting the four operators for radically different results, the sonic scope of BLEASS Omega is vast. The included library of over 160 professionally designed presets makes full use of this versatility, furnishing you with a varied and inspirational sound palette to use in your music-making and sound design projects.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BLEASS Omega fits in with your workflow and studio setup, no matter how you like to create.

Babylon keeps things sleek and simple with a one-page design, featuring all major parameters on a single interface page. Of course, a synth is only as good as it sounds and they've included hundreds of waveforms and presets to choose from. Babylon can turn its hand to any kind of instrumentation including different types of leads, basses, pads, organs, keys, FX and more. With powerful multi-voice oscillators, stereo unison &amp; detuning, high quality filters, effects and an internal modulation matrix Babylon can stand with the big boys because it’s powerful, but perfectly formed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/16713/content_babylon-3d-pluginboutique.jpg\" style=\"height:290px; width:600px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Microtonal Tuning</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Very unusual for a soft-synth, with Babylon you can tune every individual note to its own frequency and play quartertone and microtonal scales. These would not normally be able to be played in standard tuning and make for some extremely fun experimental harmonics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/16715/content_1.jpg\" style=\"height:75px; width:800px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Scale Helper</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Babylon comes complete with 23 standard and 34 traditional scales and modes from the Middle East. You can choose a scale, a key and see the notes of the scale highlighted on the virtual keyboard. Microtonal tuning is also set up automatically. Using a modern synthesizer to play scales from all over the world has never been easier. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Presets</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With 257 high-resolution waveforms, you’re sure to find the perfect starting point for your own sounds. Alongside many variants of the classic oscillator shapes, W.A Production have included formant, gritty, voice and instrument waveforms for maximum versatility. These can all be inverted and reversed (or both). Over 2300 preset sounds have been expertly programmed and are catalogued into themes within the onboard browser so you can easily find what you need in a hurry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Effects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A full range of FX are included: Distortion, Bit rate and Sample Rate Reduction, Filter, Chorus, EQ, Delay and Reverb. These can be reordered by simply clicking and dragging, making for a logical approach to FX routing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/16714/content_2.jpg\" style=\"height:102px; width:359px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Unique Features</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>W.A Production could list all of the great features of Babylon, but instead, allow them to point out some aspects which they think are unique in the world of soft-synths. The filter section features not only standard controls but also 5 characterful poly effects: drive, distortion, saturation, crush and LoFi. There’s a dedicated Vibrato LFO with delay &amp; attack settings for smooth vibrato transitions. Babylon has 12 different curve types for ADSR and Filter programming.

Not only is the engine more capable than existing offerings, but the choice to use natural and environmental samples gave the instrument its unique character. The user interface was designed to allow rapid access to inspirational parameters via macro controls on the main ‘Wild’ page whilst also presenting access to the deep editing environment. Extensive modulation and modifier routes are intuitively assigned and all parameters are available for DAW automation. Dive into the weird and wonderful immersive world of BioTek.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Spinal Saw Oscillator</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The unique ‘Spinal Saw’ oscillator allows you to have up to 11 detuned sawtooth waves within a single oscillator. Considering BioTek features 4 oscillators per voice, this gives you a total of 44 sawteeth per sound layer – and you can have unlimited sound layers per patch. Perfect for making thick leads, huge pads, and rumbling synth basses – unleash the beast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Granular Oscillator</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The BioTek 2 granular oscillator extracts sound grains from the sample of your choice and redistributes them into dense clouds, scattered drops, or any density in-between. This allows you to create everything from uniquely textured musical instruments to otherworldly soundscapes. The oscillator itself provides a useful visual reference for how the grains relate to the source sample, showing playback position and pitch relationships. The BioTek 2 granular oscillator brings a mighty storm surge of synthesis to an already powerful engine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/25716/original_BioTek2_settings_interface.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 460px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Deep Parameter Control</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>BioTek’s unlimited engine can scale to literally tens of thousands of parameters so managing the workflow is key. The intuitive system for importing your own samples and promoting parameters to the main ‘Wild’ macro page allows you to quickly construct your own instrument. The customizable ‘Wild’ page macro controls are immediately accessible to your DAW automation and new in version 2 is the ability to also access the entire parameter list from the deep editing pages. You have unprecedented control over all the instruments' sound-shaping tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/25717/original_BioTek2_ring_interface.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 457px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Surgical Precision</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No synthesizer is complete without a comprehensive filtering and effects section. BioTek has a full complement of both – 9 high-quality effects can be loaded into 4 effect slots per voice allowing for extensive creative sound shaping. Filtering is also extremely flexible with numerous types to choose from, now including Transistor Ladder and Sallen-Key in BioTek 2 – sculpt your sound with surgical precision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/25718/original_BioTek2_settings_filter_interface.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 459px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Creative Horsepower</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>BioTek features 4 oscillators per sound layer capable of creating multiple forms of synthesis: FM Synthesis, Virtual Analog, Sample Playback, Karplus-Strong, and now also Granular and the unique Spinal Saw. With unlimited sound layers per patch, you can create simple or extremely complex, expressive instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A Breath Of Life</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>BioTek takes modulation to the next level – it features 200 modulation routes and 32 modifier routes performing mathematical functions on the modulation sources. It also features 8 unique Flow LFOs, each with 8 individual parallel syncable sub LFOs on every sound layer. With so much routing available, it is possible to program “life”, an organic randomness, into your sounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Instant Control</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>BioTek’s signature ‘Wild’ macro page allows you to rapidly explore each sound patch with surprising depth. The stunning central XY control is typically assigned to numerous sound-shaping parameters allowing for immediate and sometimes extreme manipulations. While the unique ‘Flow LFO’s’ invite you to dynamically perform variations in the modulation assignments. Each patch is individually designed to present the most interesting sound-shaping tools right at your fingertips, then dive deep into the editing pages to fully customize your sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>All About The Sound</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All instruments are not created equal! BioTek’s codebase was skillfully created by the industry veteran, Wolfram Franke who refined his craft by designing a long list of instruments for Waldorf Music – revered for their outstanding depth of sound. Sculpting this beast into weird and wonderful soundscapes has been the task of some of the most prominent sound designers of our day – led by Taiho Yamada and most recently adding electronic experimental guru Richard Devine, the factory patch list has swelled to over 500 deeply creative sonic experiments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Biotek Sample Library</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help set BioTek apart from the status quo, an entirely new collection of audio samples was required. Enter composer and engineer, Mike Wall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BioTek’s natural and environmental sounds are samples from Mike’s collection spanning 20 years of field recording in Washington, Oregon, California, North Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado, Arizona, and Hawaii, with a bit of Texas stirred in (for seasoning). For the industrial sounds, Mike did location recording at several manufacturing facilities near Seattle. Mike achieved exceptionally high resolution and low noise by utilizing various stereo microphones, hydro-phone rigs and digital recorders that are customized for intense field conditions. The samples were carefully looped and mastered for the Acktion Engine™.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Spinal Saw Oscillator Type with up to 11 sawtooth oscillators in one, with FM and in-oscillator sync</li>\r\n\t<li>Granular Sample Oscillator Type, with FM</li>\r\n\t<li>Transistor Ladder Filter Type with 6, 12, 18 and 24 dB lowpass characteristic and resonance up to self-oscillation for all slopes</li>\r\n\t<li>Sallen-Key Filter Type with 12 dB lowpass characteristic</li>\r\n\t<li>Automation of all parameters (some hosts might be limited to first sound layer)</li>\r\n\t<li>Dedicated browser page with filters for author, category, style and timbre and full-text search</li>\r\n\t<li>Assign Source Info Menus showing where a modulation source is assigned to</li>\r\n\t<li>500+ factory patches</li>\r\n\t<li>4 virtual analog/sample playback oscillators</li>\r\n\t<li>4 operator FM synthesis (can use samples)</li>\r\n\t<li>Sync, Ring Mod, PWM, waveshaping</li>\r\n\t<li>2 multimode filters in series with distortion and EQ</li>\r\n\t<li>Filter Types: 4-pole &amp; 2-pole LP, BP, HP, BS (Notch) 1-pole LP, HP Comb (Tuned Delay for Karplus Strong) Redux (SR, Bit Reducer)</li>\r\n\t<li>200 modulation routes, 32 modifier routes (performing mathematical functions on the modulation sources), assignable GUI macro controls</li>\r\n\t<li>8 Flow LFOs (each with 8 individual parallel syncable sub LFOs)</li>\r\n\t<li>4 effects in series</li>\r\n\t<li>Effects Types: Reverb Delay Compressor/Limiter Distortion Chorus Flanger Phaser Redux</li>\r\n\t<li>4 envelopes (can be up to 32 stages with looping sustain and release sections, curvatures for each stage)</li>\r\n\t<li>Sample import (Osc), MID file import (Arp)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>*All above features are for a single sound layer (unlimited layers can be created for a single patch).</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>System Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mac</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>macOS 10.8 or Later</li>\r\n\t<li>Intel Core 2 Duo 2GHz Processor </li>\r\n\t<li>2GB RAM (8GB Recommended)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PC</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Windows 7, 8, 10</li>\r\n\t<li>Intel Core 2 Duo 2GHz Processor </li>\r\n\t<li>2GB RAM (8GB Recommended)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Requires a DAW host software to run and 1GB available disk space.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>"}

ODD switches the oscillator to create odd harmonics only, If you additionally bring in DEEP, you will notice the waveforms to resemble saw or square shapes (with ODD active). In addition, each oscillator has its own amplitude envelope. So all you need for creating the core sound is right there!</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Modulate It</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/17509/content_bolt_modeg_left_strt.jpg\" style=\"height:373px; width:330px\"></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nSounds come to life with modulation: So Bolt offers four powerful modulation generators. Its 3 LFOs and one Modulation Envelope Generator ensure a host of modulation possibilities. No matter, if you are after snappy transients or would like to modulate different aspects of the sound all at the same time – you can do all of that and more. The modulation generators can even modulate each other if you want to push the envelope. The best is, that it’s easy to experiment: Modulation Targets are pre-assigned, so you simply need to bring up a target amount to hear an effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The MODULATION EG is modelled after classic ADSR envelopes and cover a range from ultra-snappy and percussive to lush soundscapes. The 4 modulation Targets can be assigned to many destinations, including LFO Frequency and Intensity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/17510/content_bolt_lfo_right.jpg\" style=\"height:336px; width:330px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bolt’s Low Frequency Oscillators go beyond the range you’d expect from a typical LFO. They offer an extended range from 0.01 Hz up to 10 kHz. So they go well into the audible range which allows for some extreme modulation effects, including amplitude and frequency modulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/17511/content_lfo_animation.gif\" style=\"height:160px; width:150px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nChoose from 13 different waveforms, including Random and stepped waves. Switch Cycle off to use the LFOs as additional auxiliary envelopes – or sync them to the beat. Of course, each of them can be synced differently, so you can create interesting poly-rhythms. You can even assign them to cross-modulate each other's tempo. You’ll probably never run out of new interesting modulation combinations to try out…</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Refine It</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/17512/content_bolt_effects_top.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:330px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nFour integrated effects processors ensure that Bolt’s patches are ready to be dropped into your productions: EQ, CHORUS, DELAY and REVERB provide the essential effects at your fingertips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The effects are optimized ease of use, only 3 parameters per processor ensure you’ll get to results quickly. Still, you’ll find enough tweakability including tempo sync for the DELAY or parametric and bandpass modes for the EQ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There’s a lot more that can be said about Bolt – but it’s all about the sound isn’t it?

Our enhancements translate to vastly expanded possibilities for sound design and avant-garde music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You’ve always wanted to paint with sound. Now you can with the Buchla Easel V.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One look at the Buchla Easel V and you know this is a different beast. In fact, it makes you think differently about sound right from the start—and the soundscapes you can design with it are as unique as the front panel array. To put that experience at your fingertips, we meticulously recreated the rare 1973 Buchla Music Easel right down to the component level. As you’ve come to expect from our other V-series instruments, we’ve gone the extra mile by designing in an enhanced feature set including polyphony, innovative new modulation/control sources, step sequencer, effects, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you like to paint outside the lines, Buchla Easel V is the perfect artistic tool for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10887/content_buchla_easel_01_plugin_boutique.jpg\" style=\"height:404px; width:700px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align:center\">Welcome to West Coast school of synthesis</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Your music breaks from the pack. So does the Buchla Easel V.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Buchla Easel V faithfully reproduces Buchla’s Music Easel that helped define West Coast synthesis’ focus on experimentation and breaking musical norms. We’ve applied our award-winning TAE™ modeling technology from the front panel to the resistors to capture it all with incredible realism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Complex oscillator design, AM and FM synthesis, uniquely percussive gate/filter combos, and numerous ways to modulate and clock just about every parameter, all drop you right in the middle of a sonic sandbox. Design and perform soundscapes that burble, shimmer, pulse and evolve without ever touching a keyboard or pad—unless you want to add even more control. Nearly 300 presets by expert sound designers get you started with timbres ranging from hauntingly beautiful sonorities to clangorous pokes in the ear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you’re looking to experiment with simple sounds or build complex evolving passages, the Buchla Easel V is a constant source of inspiration for sonic adventurers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10886/content_buchla_easel_02_plugin_boutique.jpg\" style=\"height:369px; width:700px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align:center\">Create sounds no one has ever heard before</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to faithfully reproducing a classic, we’ve infused the Buchla Easel V with even more of that vintage goodness to love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ve made patching even more fun and foolproof. When you drag a color-coded patchcord between patch points, only valid targets light up, saving you the frustration of making invalid connections that do nothing. The original Music Easel lacked a noise source, so we’ve added one to the preamp—handy for introducing rhythmic elements. We’ve also designed a feedback loop into the preamp, so you can really get things howling. Up to four-voice polyphony greatly enhances your performance capabilities, too.*</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With our extensions to Buchla’s original design, you now have an even more intuitive programming experience paired with additional sonic options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Note that while our extreme modeling at the component level on the Buchla Easel V delivers insanely great analog sound, each voice of polyphony requires significant processing power to pull it off—approximately 20 percent of an i7 CPU per voice.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align:center\">New control, new inspiration</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Electronic music is as much about expression as it is about sound generation—and Buchla Easel V delivers new expressive capabilities beyond your wildest dreams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ve dramatically expanded the functionality of the original Music Easel while respecting the instrument’s unique personality and design philosophy. One click reveals all the new additions. The Left Hand section provides five full-featured Function Generators individually routable to any of 76 modulation targets. The Right Hand section gives you a modern step sequencer with innovative options. Gravity is an X/Y grid that uses the physics of a bouncing ball influenced by attraction, repulsion and collision with objects to generate unique, unexpected modulation signals.

One listen and you’ll be really big on the new, improved CZ V.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like you, we love synths of every flavor. That’s why we just had to recreate the true essence of Casio’s patented phase distortion synthesis that made their CZ series so popular. You don’t need to understand how phase distortion works—just let your ears tell you how cool and unique it would sound in your music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you’ve come to expect from all of Arturia’s V Collection, our enhancements transform CZ into an even more formidable sonic force that can transform your music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/14897/content_01_1_1.jpg\" style=\"height:387px; width:800px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>A simpler kind of powerful digital synthesis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Released in 1984, the CZ-101 was Casio’s answer to the wildly popular Yamaha DX7. It was significantly less expensive and infinitely easier to program than its rival. Instead of frequency modulation, Casio’s phase distortion (PD) used various user-selected waveforms to modulate the timing of simple carrier waves at the cycle level in order to create more complex wave shapes. This simplified form of digital synthesis made it comparatively easy to perfect a wide variety of timbres spanning warm pads, natural percussion, buzzy digitalia, sci-fi effects and even analog synths. While PD could sound similar to FM, it also had a unique sonic signature all its own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CZ sound helped propel artists like Salt-N-Pepa, Was (Not Was), and Vince Clarke into the spotlight. Let’s add your name to the list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/14898/content_02_2_1.jpg\" style=\"height:461px; width:800px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Classic Casio Phase Distortion + cutting-edge Arturia modelling = infinite sonic possibilities for you</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imagine a virtual instrument that realistically models every nuance of the CZ-101—and with four times the polyphony and zillions more presets. What if it gave you an intuitive graphic interface that unlocked of all the hidden jewels in this unique digital synth? And what if it now had additional envelopes, filters, LFOs, effects, and extensive beat-sync-to-host parameters? Oh, and what if you could interconnect all that via a new super-flexible modulation matrix?

Craft totally unique sounds and finish more songs with Circle².</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Circle² is the new major update to Future Audio Workshop’s flagship software synthesizer, Circle. Since its release in 2009, Circle has achieved cult status, becoming a key tool in the arsenal of both seminal underground and pop hitmakers such as Hudson Mohawke, Arca, David Guetta and Deadmau5. The 2015 update incorporates several new features, modules and effects, extending the spectrum of sounds that can be composed. Circle² also features a completely redesigned user interface, providing a forward-thinking interpretation of Circle's esteemed user-centred design approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usability is at the heart of the design of Circle². With the affordance of the power of modern computer processors, many software synthesizers have become progressively more complex and difficult to use. The aim of Circle is to step aside from this path and to instead focus on placing flow and intuitiveness at the core of the music-making process. Rather than burying a deluge of synthesis parameters in submenus and external windows, Circle² encourages experimentation by presenting parameters in an accessible and intuitive manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The unique Circle² interface enables a level of experimentation that would be unachievable via a more typical, convoluted interface; allowing the user to focus on creativity rather than technicalities. This design philosophy sets Circle² apart in the synthesizer landscape and provides the foundation for the development of the next generation. Instead of designing Circle² to graphically replicate its analog predecessors, Future Audio Workshop have been working alongside Berlin-based designer Lars Hammerschmidt to bring Circle² firmly into the 21st century through the use of a contemporary design language that looks more to the future than the past. The goal was to construct an even flatter design with brighter, more distinct colors than was seen in Circle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Everything In One Window</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Fast and streamlined workflow while sound designing</li>\r\n\t<li>Forget messy submenus, multiple windows, and hidden controls</li>\r\n\t<li>Create unique sounds with minimal effort</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Modulation Made Simple</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Free yourself from the clunky modulation matrix</li>\r\n\t<li>Simply drag and drop color-coded circles</li>\r\n\t<li>Quickly create dynamic sounds full of motion</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<strong>VPS: A New Kind Of Synthesis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Create harmonically rich tones that morph over time</li>\r\n\t<li>Great for evolving leads, gritty basses, ethereal pads and contorted sounds</li>\r\n\t<li>Only available in Circle²</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on state-of-the-art digital synthesis research, the brand new VPS (vector phase shaping synthesis) oscillator is one of the most exciting new features of Circle². The new oscillator utilizes a cutting-edge synthesis technique introduced by researchers at the Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering and The National University of Ireland, and further developed for its implementation in Circle² via an academic collaboration with Future Audio Workshop. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The VPS oscillator works by glueing together a pair of sine waves with specified frequencies. Via its two parameters - which control the frequencies of the sine waves and the location at which they are glued - the VPS oscillator provides direct control of the waveform’s intricate harmonics. Experimentation throughout the oscillator development process has led to a range of results; from dirty Reese style bass patches to ethereal pads and gritty lead lines. Modulating the parameters can produce a wide range of effects, either used subtly to give gentle movement, or used harshly to twist and contort a synth into oblivion. We’re excited to hear what synthesis results users can achieve using the new oscillator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Sounds You Want When You Want Them</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Quickly browse over 300 patches with our Smart Browser</li>\r\n\t<li>Curate a library of your Favorite Patches to access them instantly</li>\r\n\t<li>New patch packs from expert sound designers added regularly</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ready To Perform With NKS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Works with Maschine &amp; Komplete Kontrol</li>\r\n\t<li>Meticulously mapped for every patch</li>\r\n\t<li>Need a refill?

No keyboard collection is complete without it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The “Clav” sound is so iconic that most keyboards have a patch that tries to emulate it. Why settle for an approximation?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the first note you play on the Clavinet V, you know this is no sample or synth. You feel that organic grit that only comes from a physical instrument, reproduced in minute detail by our award-winning modeling technology. We recreated the iconic Clavinet D6—including lightning response, multiple pickups, EQ rockers and variable mute. You can even tech your own customizations to age your instrument to taste.

Top keyboardists of the ‘70s used its signature bark and bite to cut through the mix while delivering some of the most authoritative percussive keyboard lines ever played. Thanks to the ultra-realistic Clavinet V, you can now command the same crisp sound that helped define funk and formed the bedrock of many pop and R&amp;B hits back in the day. If you’re looking to add natural energy and vintage cred to your sound, the Clavinet V is just the ticket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Clavinet V inspires with both the sound and feel of the funkiest electric keyboard ever made.

By comparison, “Clav” synth patches and samples seem one-dimensional. That’s why we’ve applied our award-winning physical modeling and algorithmic emulation to give you a sound and playing experience indistinguishable from the real thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Clavinet V brings all the inspiring nuances and natural goodness of the original instrument to your keyboard collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10884/content_clavinet_v_2_plugin_boutique.jpg\" style=\"height:318px; width:700px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align:center\">More than a Clavinet</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Clavinet V delivers all the original features, plus new additions designed to keep your creative juices flowing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original Clavinet controls were simple to use, and we’ve kept them authentic. If you want to go deeper, just click the lid open and you can easily tweak exactly how your instrument sounds and behaves. The built-in collection of effects pedals—chorus, flanger, wah and more—let you easily get the rich signature sounds of the keyboardists who popularized the instrument. You’ll also find an integral vintage guitar amp, so you never have to look elsewhere to get just the sound you’re looking for.

Over the past 3 decades, Klaus has worked with numerous industry titans including Korg, Alesis, Clavia, Yamaha, and many more. All the while amassing a vast array of instrument samples of the highest quality specifically for use in sample playback engines. Working closely with the Tracktion VI development team, one of the largest assortments of Klaus’s instruments were meticulously reviewed, edited, and voiced to provide a diverse sonic playground for you to explore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Synthesis Engine</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Collective is designed to be much more than just a high-quality sample playback engine. It is also a deeply capable synthesis platform allowing for a wide array of electronic sounds to be generated with ease. It is the combination of these capabilities that allow the sound design team – and indeed yourselves – to create ultra hi-def sounds. Layering subtle synthesis textures under real samples can produce vibrant results that mimic real-world spaces and if desired, enhance. When exploring the electronic capabilities of the synthesis engine, you will discover a comprehensive array of features including virtual analogue, 4 operator FM, filters, LFO’s, envelopes, and a creative selection of FX. Collective packs a world of sounds into a single, easy to use, ever-expanding premium virtual instrument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Diversity &amp; Evolution</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a world full of VI’s filled with mediocre sounds touting thousands of presets, Collective is designed to be different. Over 600 factory sounds have been meticulously crafted to provide a diverse array of both real-world instruments and electronica. You will find not only the obvious but also the obscure, allowing you to quickly locate the sounds you feel for your compositions and explore new soundscapes from around the world. To keep things exciting, the content is evolving through the expansion packs themed for different musical genres and musical moments to keep you inspired.

Use your Linnstrument, Roli Seaboard, Haken Continuum, Madrona Labs Soundplane, or Sensel Morph (among others) to directly access per-note pressure, pitch bend, and modulation. </li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Per-Instance Settings:</strong> Continua utilizes a per-instance customization method: set MPE mode, aftertouch smoothing, pitch bend range override, tuning table, and global tuning offset for each instance in your DAW, with an option to save any state as your global starting point.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Factory Presets:</strong> Continua comes with a substantial collection of factory content, including Designer Presets from Red Means Recording, Glitch Machines, and Sonalsystem.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Cross-Platform Preset Format: </strong>Continua utilizes an XML-based preset manager. Work between multiple systems without troubles.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Fully Resizable Hi-Dpi/Retina GUI: </strong>Continua's vector-based GUI is resolution-agnostic, and displays the same on every system and resolution. Easily resize the UI (per instance) to match your visual needs, from postage stamp to poster-sized.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>System Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mac</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>macOS 10.12 Sierra or newer <strong>(64-bit only)</strong>\n</li>\r\n\t<li>VST, VST3, AU, AAAX</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PC</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Windows 8.1 or newer <strong>(64-bit only)</strong>\n</li>\r\n\t<li>VST, VST3, AAX</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Linux</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Ubuntu 18 or later <strong>(64-bit only)</strong>\n</li>\r\n\t<li>VST, VST3</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Important Note: </strong>This software is 64-bit compatible only and will not function on 32-bit systems.</p>\r\n</div>"}

So is the sound of the DX7 V.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frequency modulation (FM) synthesis works by modulating one waveform with another to produce much more complex harmonic profiles than its analog brethren. These sounds run the gamut from acoustic and organic to synthetic and mechanical, spanning energies from subtle to radical along the way. Thanks to an extensive preset library, you don’t have to be an expert on FM in order to tap into all this sonic power. The DX7 V comes complete with a library of all the signature 80’s hit-making FM sounds like electric pianos, basses, marimbas, synths and more, plus an extensive battery of hot new sounds from our elite sound design team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you’re looking for the familiar sounds that put FM synthesis on the map or charting new territory, the DX7 V is the definitive digital synth to have in your keyboard collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10875/content_dx7_v_plugin_boutique_2.jpg\" style=\"height:376px; width:700px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align:center\">Unleash your inner sound designer with expanded features</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The DX7 V gives you a unique tool for customizing and creating new musical instruments and sound effects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With its radical departure from analog designs, FM synthesis helps you chart new sonic spaces. The DX7 V is capable of producing an incredible spectrum of sounds ranging from natural-sounding instruments to unique synths to alien worlds—complete with all the crystal clarity and punchy transients uniquely associated with FM. Since having an instrument with such extreme depth and potential is the dream of every sonic explorer, we challenged ourselves to go even further. We added a host of new features including multiple waveforms, a filter and feedback loop on each operator, new modulation sources, a monster unison mode, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DX7 V is the perfect design tool for designing unique new instruments and ear candy that help you make your own distinct musical statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10876/content_dx7_v_plugin_boutique_3.jpg\" style=\"height:428px; width:700px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align:center\">Design elegance meets sound design power</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The DX7 V sports a stunning interface allowing intuitive control over all of the instrument’s dramatically expanded features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While retaining the feel of the original design, we’ve streamlined the main interface of the DX7 V to make it much simpler to use and understand.

The recent progress in this field made him believe that there is a vast opportunity in applying machine learning to sound design. After quitting his day job it took almost two years of research and dozens of prototypes to develop the innovative sound engine and user interface of Abyss.

Diversion takes the full advantage of modern processors to bring you the perfect sound quality that fits standards of hardware synthesizers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sound Generation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diversion offers 4 oscillators with a wide range of different waveforms with a near to zero level of aliasing. The oscillators generate sounds in real-time by using our algorithms, which don't degrade the sound quality at high frequencies. All waveforms have two independent parameters X and Y allowing you to adjust the timbre of the produced sound. The oscillators also feature such synthesis techniques as FM, RM, wave shaping and filtering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since version 1.2 Diversion offers comprehensive Wavetable Editor, which allows you to load arbitrary single cycle WAV files. With new Wavetable Editor, it is possible to edit waveforms both in time and frequency space as well as apply different effects. Since version 1.3, Diversion provides sample playback with granular synthesis and output audio recording.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/13279/content_diversion-oscillator-pluginboutique.jpg\" style=\"height:154px; width:342px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bus processors</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two bus processors in Diversion allow you to transform the oscillators' output into a wide variety of possible sounds. Each bus processor consists of a stereo filter with lots of different modes, distortion and LO-FI section. We have implemented many filter modes and types of saturation stages to bring you a great armoury for creating arbitrary patches, including popular Trance, Psy, Dub Step and Ambient sounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/13282/content_diversion-bus-pluginboutique.jpg\" style=\"height:118px; width:343px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Effects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diversion uses two flexible FX lines for a separated processing of each bus processor?s output. With the separated FX processing you can make lots of layered sounds, even which has two parts located in two fully independent sound spaces. Up to 8 effect instances can be stacked in one FX line, which is enough to create any desired processing chain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/13281/content_diversion-fxmatrix-pluginboutique.jpg\" style=\"height:74px; width:347px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Oversampling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typically, after a non-linear processing of the waveform inside the oscillators and bus processors, digital aliasing can occur. Diversion takes care of this by using oversampling up to 8X within a whole processing path, excluding FX section. Models of all processing modules in Diversion are designed using at least 2X oversampling. This allows Diversion to achieve a perfect sound quality with an insignificant level of aliasing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Modulation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many parameters in Diversion can be modulated by 4 LFOs, 4 ADSR Envelopes, 4 MSEGs and one XY-controller, called Master Morph. These options, along with use of the Modulation Matrix, can really breathe life into a sound. Of course, automation and midi controllers are supported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/13283/content_diversion-modulators-pluginboutique.jpg\" style=\"height:74px; width:345px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Arpeggiator and Trance Gate</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last but not least, Diversion features a 32-step Arpeggiator / Sequencer and a 16-step Trance Gate module, which turns Diversion into a full-fledged workstation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/13284/content_diversion-arpeggiator-pluginboutique.jpg\" style=\"height:79px; width:345px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>System Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Diversion's audio engine may consume lots of CPU power.

The innovative design blends flexible dual-wave morphing oscillators, stereo filters, fully polyphonic analog strings, extensive and easy-to-use modulation, studio-quality effects, and MPE support, all in an elegant vintage-style synth interface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>An Era of Innovation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dreamsynth draws its inspiration from renowned synths including the Ensoniq ESQ-1, the Kawai \"K\" series, and the Sequential Prophet VS. In the second half of the '80s, music production was rapidly transitioning from analog to digital. These \"hybrid\" synthesizers bridged the gap, combining the precision and flexibility of sampled digital oscillators with the warmth of analog filters. The combination of digital and analog sound produced instruments with character and a unique sonic fingerprint that still resonates today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A Dream Come True</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the magic of these vintage classics in mind, Cherry Audio set out to create Dreamsynth. Dreamsynth is a \"What if...?\" synthesizer incorporating the distinctive qualities of this remarkable era with the best features of modern software instruments to create a uniquely 21st-century hybrid. Here's a look at the highlights:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Three dual-waveform oscillators amount to six simultaneous virtual analog or PCM sample-based oscillators with up to 16 voices of polyphony. When modulation is applied, the unique A/B wave mix controls can create a myriad of evolving or rhythmic vector tones.</li>\r\n\t<li>Combines authentic analog waveforms with sampled PCM waveforms for incredible new timbres. Includes a massive library of 430 looping, one-shot, and single-cycle waveforms.</li>\r\n\t<li>Dreamsynth also includes a beautiful-sounding classic string synthesizer that, unlike traditional paraphonic string synths, is fully polyphonic. It operates independently of the oscillator-based synthesizer, and both can be layered and split across the keyboard, with separate assignments for the arpeggiator and effects.</li>\r\n\t<li>The OB-style 12 dB/octave multimode stereo filters enable breathtaking timbres from subtle to extreme.</li>\r\n\t<li>Dreamsynth features exceptional modulation capabilities with 20 mod sources and over 40 destinations. Routings are immediately accessible through the innovative interface with individual pop-up menus and invertible knobs.</li>\r\n\t<li>The effects section includes multiple distortion and sample-crushing options, a 12-stage phaser, chorus, flanger, and rotary speaker effects. Also available are numerous delay (including Cherry Audio's acclaimed tape delay) and reverb effects, including the fabulous new \"Galactic\" algorithm.</li>\r\n\t<li>Supports MIDI Polyphonic Expression (MPE), making Dreamsynth capable of more organic and expressive performances.</li>\r\n\t<li>Dreamsynth includes a massive library of over 1100 presets from a wildly talented and diverse group of sound designers such as Dave Polich, Huston Singletary, Julie Kathryn (I AM SNOW ANGEL), James Terris, Julian Pollack (J3PO), Katharine Fountain aka FOUNTAINS, Agent Method, Mark Wilcox, Joseph Holiday, and Venus Theory.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Three dual-waveform oscillators, amounting to six simultaneous virtual analog or PCM sample-based oscillators with up to 16 voices of polyphony</li>\r\n\t<li>Authentically modeled virtual analog waveforms and 430 looping, one-shot, and single-cycle waveforms</li>\r\n\t<li>Fully polyphonic 16-voice string synthesizer which can be layered and split across the keyboard independent of the primary synth</li>\r\n\t<li>OB-style 12 dB/octave multimode stereo filters</li>\r\n\t<li>Extensive and accessible modulation capabilities, with 20 mod sources and over 40 destinations, including effects</li>\r\n\t<li>Analog drift control for increased authenticity</li>\r\n\t<li>Three tempo-syncable LFOs</li>\r\n\t<li>Arpeggiator with tempo sync, independently assignable to the synth and string synth</li>\r\n\t<li>Fully modulatable effects include multiple distortion and sample-crushing options, a 12-stage phaser, chorus, flanger, rotary speaker effects, delay, and reverb, including the new \"Galactic\" reverb algorithm</li>\r\n\t<li>Polyphonic Aftertouch as a polyphonic modulation source</li>\r\n\t<li>Support for MIDI Polyphonic Expression (MPE)</li>\r\n\t<li>Highly optimized coding for optimal performance with ultra-low CPU load</li>\r\n\t<li>User-adjustable oversampling control</li>\r\n\t<li>Advanced one-click UI magnification</li>\r\n\t<li>Complete MIDI control and DAW automation for all controls</li>\r\n\t<li>Over 1100 presets created by a talented and diverse group of sound design veterans</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>System Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mac</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>10.13 or above.</li>\r\n\t<li>macOS 13 Ventura supported.</li>\r\n\t<li>64-bit required.</li>\r\n\t<li>Native Apple M1 processor support, including Apple M1 Ultra.</li>\r\n\t<li>3.4 GHz Quad-Core or M1 CPU with 8GB of RAM recommended.</li>\r\n\t<li>Available in AU, VST, VST3, AAX &amp; Standalone formats</li>\r\n\t<li>MPE (requires DAW and hardware controller that supports MIDI Polyphonic Expression)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Windows</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Windows 7 or above (including Windows 11), 64-bit required.</li>\r\n\t<li>Quad-core computer with 8GB of RAM recommended.</li>\r\n\t<li>Available in VST, VST3, AAX &amp; Standalone formats</li>\r\n\t<li>MPE (requires DAW and hardware controller that supports MIDI Polyphonic Expression)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>"}

The \"ELECTRIBE-R\", loved by track makers all over the world, is revived for your DAW.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It began with an experiment. The first-generation ELECTRIBE series was based on the concept of a fun way to choose spicy and unique stand-alone instruments that could be used as add-ons for electronic music, rather than large devices trying to cover all parts in one machine, depending on your preference. The software (preloaded tone creation) was handmade by KORG's voicing staff with the idea of \"a rhythm machine that allows you to develop sounds and easily create contemporary music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This version is based on the \"iELECTRIBE for iPad\" released in 2010, but has expanded the beat modes and effects of the step sequencer to include the original \"ELECTRIBE-R\" and \"ELECTRIBE-R mkII\" as well as all the preset data from the \"iELECTRIBE for iPad\" and \"ELECTRIBE for iPhone”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35807/original_7484ca81c78d150a44ccec3460249c10_pc.gif\" width=\"600\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sound Source Section for Flexible Sound Creation.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sound source section, which follows the original \"ELECTRIBE-R\" synth engine but further expands it, has a total of nine parts: four synth parts, PCM hi-hat (open and closed), cymbals, claps/snare, and accents. The synth part has four selectable waveforms (sine, triangle, square, and sawtooth), which can be processed by six different modulation types. The PCM part also offers six different modulation types for further processing. Each part has an AMP section for volume, note length, panning, and level only low boost adjustment for the accent. Despite its simple configuration, it is surprisingly versatile and can be used to create a wide range of groove patterns and matching sounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35808/original_00f682f9feec41d2e47e64141de65200_pc.jpg\" width=\"600\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Extended Effects Section.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ELECTRIBE-R has a total of 15 types of effects (more than the original “ELECTIBE-R”, including a compressor, Valve Force for warm overdrive, distortion, and a slicer that can be used for tricky rhythm making, enabling more diverse sound creation than ever before.

The original \"ELECTRIBE-R\" had a limited number of parameters that could be stored, but this version has been expanded to store all parameters per part. As with the original, two types of motion behavior can be selected: \"Smooth,\" which smoothly connects changes between steps, and \"TRIG HOLD,\" which produces staircase-like changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"399\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35810/original_31076482f0120db455c639bcff6b98a2_pc.gif\" width=\"600\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Step Sequencer Section That Is Super Easy to Use!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This step sequencer is based on the first-generation \"ELECTRIBE-R,\" which has an established reputation for high visibility and ease of input. With this version, not only can the number of pattern steps be freely set, but also the pattern resolution can be selected from nine types. In addition to the standard 4-beat patterns of 1/8, 1/16, and 1/32, there are also 3-beat/shuffle patterns of 1/12 and 1/24, as well as 1/10, 1/20, 1/14, and 1/28 suitable for 5- and 7-beat patterns, allowing for a wider range of beat-making applications. In addition to the main page, an edit page dedicated to pattern input has been added, allowing you to set patterns, mutes/solos, accents, and effect sends for all parts, as well as motion sequence input, for more precise beat making with a clear view of the entire pattern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35811/original_d3513830f08383fea5856d1646552b36_pc.jpg\" width=\"600\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>352 Spicy and Varied Built-in Patterns.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the idea of a rhythm machine that allows you to freely create your own sounds doesn't conjure up sound images for you... try listening to the built-in preset patterns! The built-in patterns include all the patterns from the original \"ELECTRIBE-R\" and \"ELECTRIBE-R mkII\" as well as those for the ELECTRIBE versions of the iPad and iPhone, as well as genre-specific template patterns, for a total of 352 types of patterns. Clicking on a pattern name on the main page opens the Pattern Browser, where you can select a pattern from 40 different categories, such as by model or genre. You can also search for patterns, register favorites and pattern sets, and, of course, store user patterns in memory. The ELECTRIBE-R has a wide variety of built-in patterns, from orthodox patterns and patterns with a rich vintage taste to crazy patterns that you would never expect to find on a rhythm machine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35812/original_43a7d8c61ea09affe5f08dc09035cd3f_pc.png\" width=\"600\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Flexibility That Only Software Can Provide.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The user interface, which follows in the footsteps of the original \"ELECTRIBE-R,\" incorporates many software features such as edit pages and pattern browsers, and the flexibility of the software is also a major feature of this version. For example, MIDI out is supported, so patterns can be created in, external sound sources can be controlled, and MIDI files can be exported easily by drag &amp; drop. Also, pattern play/stop and pattern switching can be controlled by MIDI note events, allowing for tricky play.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Sound source section for flexible sound creation.</li>\r\n\t<li>Motion sequencing function to create aggressive grooves.</li>\r\n\t<li>A step sequencer section that is super easy to use.</li>\r\n\t<li>352 spicy and varied built-in patterns.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>System Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mac</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Mac OS X 10.14 Mojave or higher (latest update)</li>\r\n\t<li>Intel Core i5 or better (Core i7 or better recommended) (<strong>Apple Silicon Native supported)</strong>\n</li>\r\n\t<li>8 GB RAM (16 GB or more recommended)</li>\r\n\t<li>8 GB free disk space (SSD recommended)</li>\r\n\t<li>AU, VST, VST3, AAX (Supported 64bit plug-ins only)</li>\r\n\t<li>An internet connection is required</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PC</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Windows 10 64bit or higher (latest update)</li>\r\n\t<li>Intel Core i5 or better (Core i7 or better recommended)</li>\r\n\t<li>8 GB RAM (16 GB or more recommended)</li>\r\n\t<li>8 GB free disk space (SSD recommended)</li>\r\n\t<li>VST, VST3, AAX (Supported 64bit plug-ins only)</li>\r\n\t<li>An internet connection is required</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>"}

Elka-X replicates the extraordinary character of the original synth without compromising sound or functionality, thoughtfully expanding its feature set and delivering the authentic Synthex experience at a price anyone can afford.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Synthex included a combination of uncommon and forward-looking features that made it stand out from other contemporary synthesizers, including highly stable digitally-controlled analog oscillators and a flexible four-pole multimode filter. Unlike most other popular synths that utilized CEM3320 filter chips in a lowpass-only configuration, the Synthex filter featured a 24 dB/oct lowpass mode, 6 and 12 dB/oct bandpass modes, and a 12 dB/oct highpass mode. Along with a powerful onboard analog chorus effect, this gave the Synthex a distinct and powerful tonality. It was multitimbral, with the ability to play two different patches simultaneously, in either split or layer mode. It even included an innovative four-track monophonic step-sequencer with real-time recording and transposition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the mid-80s, ELKA made the last Synthex for Stevie Wonder, who used it for the distinctive bass tone on his single \"Skeletons\" from the 1987 album Characters. Other notable users of the Synthex were Geoff Downes of the supergroup Asia, Keith Emerson, Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran, Peter Howell of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, and Jean-Michel Jarre, who used it extensively on Rendezvous and for his famed \"laser harp\" sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>X-pertly Extended and Enhanced!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each aspect of Elka-X has been precisely modeled upon Cherry Audio's pristine vintage Synthex. Every effort was taken to emulate the prized tone of the original's DCOs, dynamic filter, and stunning chorus. Cherry Audio have preserved the innovative sound-sculpting and performance features such as layering and keyboard split, and hugely improved the original's clunky step sequencer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once again, Cherry Audio has kept the soul of a classic alive while enhancing its feature set for modern studio environments. They've increased the polyphony, included mono and unison modes, and added velocity response that was absent from the original design. They've expanded the functionality of the filter and the LFOs, greatly extending the modulation options. Cherry Audio has not only simplified the operation of the four-track step sequencer but added a complete arpeggiator with independent assignments for both layers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unique panel controls make it painless to exchange settings between layers, sequencer tracks, and even different presets. In addition to the chorus effect found in the original, Elka-X adds studio-quality echo and reverb stereo effects, with independent settings for both layers. With additional touches such as chord memory, over 600 pro patches, and flexible MIDI mapping, Cherry Audio's Elka-X brings the authentic and expanded Synthex experience roaring into the 21st century.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Two-part multitimbral operation: two different patches simultaneously playable, in either a keyboard split or stacked layer mode, with user-specified split point and discrete controls for layer volume and panning</li>\r\n\t<li>16 polyphonic voices which can be layered or split across the keyboard</li>\r\n\t<li>Panel Control for selecting layers, with a utility function for exchanging settings between the Lower and Upper sound layers, or even between presets</li>\r\n\t<li>Two DCO oscillators with triangle, sawtooth, square, and variable pulse waveforms and independent tuning</li>\r\n\t<li>Modes for polyphonic, single voice, and unison monophonic with unison detune</li>\r\n\t<li>PWM Cross Modulation and Ring Modulation for both oscillators</li>\r\n\t<li>White or Pink Noise Generator</li>\r\n\t<li>CEM3320-style multimode filter with 12 or 24 dB/oct lowpass, 6 or 12 dB/oct bandpass, or 12 dB/oct highpass</li>\r\n\t<li>Two tempo-syncable LFOs</li>\r\n\t<li>Two independent modulation sections: a fixed LFO 1 section, and a performance-oriented LFO 2 section, intended for use with pitch and mod wheel controllers</li>\r\n\t<li>LFO 1 has triangle, sawtooth, ramp, bipolar square, unipolar square, and random waveforms; LFO 2 triangle waveform only</li>\r\n\t<li>ADSR Filter and Amplifier envelope generators with Velocity control</li>\r\n\t<li>Multi Trigger for the ADSR Filter and Amplifier envelope generators (in monophonic modes)</li>\r\n\t<li>Chord Memory and Oscillator 2 sync</li>\r\n\t<li>Tempo Sync buttons for LFO 1 and 2, Sequencer rate, Arpeggio rate, and Echo rate for easy sync to DAW project tempo</li>\r\n\t<li>Step Sequencer consists of four individual monophonic sequences, each with a user-definable length of up to 128 steps, assignable to either layer and stored with the preset</li>\r\n\t<li>Step Sequencer utility operation for copying, swapping, and moving sequencer data between tracks, or from one preset to another</li>\r\n\t<li>Glide (pitch envelope) and Portamento (standard glide), independently enabled for each oscillator</li>\r\n\t<li>Arpeggiator with tempo sync, independently assignable to both layers</li>\r\n\t<li>Studio-quality chorus, echo delay, and reverb effects, including Cherry Audio's acclaimed \"Galactic\" reverb algorithm</li>\r\n\t<li>Cherry Audio's popular Focus zoom-in feature, as well as standard UI zoom and resize with drag</li>\r\n\t<li>Over 600 presets created by a talented and diverse group of sound design veterans</li>\r\n\t<li>Complete MIDI control and DAW automation for all controls, with easy-to-use MIDI learn</li>\r\n\t<li>Preset and Global level MIDI mapping</li>\r\n\t<li>Highly optimized coding for optimal performance with ultra-low CPU load</li>\r\n\t<li>User-adjustable oversampling control </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Elka-X Synthesizer is available in AU, VST, VST3, and AAX formats.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>System Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mac</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>10.13 or above.</li>\r\n\t<li>macOS 13 Ventura supported.</li>\r\n\t<li>64-bit required.</li>\r\n\t<li>Native Apple M1 processor support, including Apple M1 Ultra.</li>\r\n\t<li>3.4 GHz Quad-Core or M1 CPU with 8GB of RAM recommended.</li>\r\n\t<li>Available in AU, VST, VST3, AAX &amp; Standalone formats</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Windows</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Windows 7 or above (including Windows 11), 64-bit required.</li>\r\n\t<li>Quad-core computer with 8GB of RAM recommended.</li>\r\n\t<li>Available in VST, VST3, AAX &amp; Standalone formats</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>"}

Choose between modern DAC and a faithful emulation of the original hardware’s DAC and let the lo-fi vibes roll...</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21880/content_screen.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 455px;\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sampler heart, Synth brain</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instrument first, sampler second. Part of what made the Emulator hardware so popular was the fact that it behaved like a synthesizer, but with the flexibility of using samples - its multitimbrality meant up to 8 samples could be played at once on your keyboard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Main Controls</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Arpeggiator</strong>: 6-mode arpeggiator to set your ideas free so you can focus on dynamics and expression.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Wheels</strong>: 2 assignable expression wheels give this sampler an expressive edge.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Master Control</strong>: Assign and cross-fade up to 8 separate samples across your keyboard range.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>LFO</strong>: Each sample is polyphonic within its keyboard zone, with its own filter, VCA, and LFO.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Effects</strong>: Add effects per sample to really customize your Emulator palette in sonic detail.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Emulator II V’s authentic 8-voice multitimbral architecture allows you to play whatever samples you choose like your own custom orchestra - complete with expression and performance tools. This classic sampler is designed to let you express yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What's New?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Emulator II V’s interface is designed to be authentic and immersive - but there’s more than meets the eye. Zoom in on the built-in display to access in-depth sampling editing, expressive modulation, and a suite of FX that go beyond the original - and that’ll cement Emulator II V as your favourite outside-the-box sampler.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Adjust the behaviour of each of your 8 ‘voices’ (samples), including transpose, sample looping, play direction, trig delay, and much more.</li>\r\n\t<li>Gain more control over your LFO settings, with parameters including rate sync, delay, variation and more.</li>\r\n\t<li>Tap into the deeper functions of the warm analogue filter and VCA to further shape the playback and tone of your samples.</li>\r\n\t<li>Choose specific FX per sample (‘voice’) to craft a palette to suit your style, from new wave to industrial techno.</li>\r\n\t<li>Switch to a DAC that suits your taste - choose from modern clean or an emulation of the original crispy digital charm.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Assign</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Control every aspect of how your keyboard/note range interacts with each of your samples, from zone assignment to aftertouch.</li>\r\n\t<li>Harness the keyboard/note input as a modulation tool - velocity, keyboard tracking, and aftertouch can be configured to manipulate the same 16 destinations.</li>\r\n\t<li>Easily assign samples to different note ranges on your keyboard by easily dragging across the visual interface.</li>\r\n\t<li>Set up the left and right expression wheels to affect 1 of 16 modulation destinations, from LFO rate to pitch transpose.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Effects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The simple addition of 11 FX algorithms is the final trick up Emulator II V’s sleeve. Whether you want to add isolated reverb to your snare sample, or just whack a swirling phaser on the master output, Emulator II V is on your level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apply an effect to any sample independently, apply up to 3 FX to the output, and opt for series or parallel depending on your tonal preference - get ready to send this sampler into sonic orbit.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Reverb</li>\r\n\t<li>Delay</li>\r\n\t<li>Chorus</li>\r\n\t<li>Flanger</li>\r\n\t<li>Phaser</li>\r\n\t<li>Overdrive</li>\r\n\t<li>Compressor</li>\r\n\t<li>Bitcrusher</li>\r\n\t<li>Multimode Filter</li>\r\n\t<li>Parametric EQ</li>\r\n\t<li>Stereo Pan</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>What Else?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TAE® Powered</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>TAE® \"True Analog Emulation\" is Arturia's exclusive technology that accurately reproduces the defining sonic qualities of analogue synthesizers.

A massive collection of wavetables, multi-samples and granular sources feed the Engines, and every Source Module incorporates its own multimode filter as well as dedicated sends to two further global filters for comprehensive tonal shaping.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Richly Detailed Samples </strong>-<strong> </strong>An integrated library of multi-sampled instruments ranges from vintage synths to the sitar, orchestral strings, and other acoustic instruments. It's accessible through the Sampler Engine, where you can also easily drag and drop your own samples.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Granular Engine</strong> - The Granular Engine slices samples into ‘grains' and helps you tweak their sequential playback, so you can create intriguing soundscapes and textures. Adjust scanning and grain generation rates, grain size and envelope shape, and more. Throw randomization into the mix for a touch – or a fistful – of glitch.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Wavetable Oscillator</strong> - The Wavetable Oscillator Engine is an inexhaustible source of classic analog waveforms, \"designed\" single-cycle waves and complex wavetables. Dial in-depth, edge, and character within the oscillator itself five unison voices, phase distortion, dual-source FM and ring modulation.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Noise Engine</strong> - A dedicated Noise Engine helps you play with noise, that essential component in percussion, pad, lead and other sounds. Choose from Pink, White and Crackle noise profiles, and customize the output with stereo Width and Density controls.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Filters and Saturation</strong> - Equator2 turns the frequency domain into your sound design playground with a dedicated multimode filter built into its six Source Modules, plus two global multimode filters switchable between four routing schemes and up to 12 more filters in the Effects section. Filter modules offer two flavours of distortion: the gentle Saturation mode and the more overtly destructive Wavefolder mode.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Global Routing</strong> - The Routing section in Equator2 allows for extensive and creative signal routing possibilities. Two multi-mode filters per voice with configurable routing allow you to send independent signal amounts through to effects, filters and ring mod to add depth, separation and complexity to your sounds.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Twist and Shape Iconic Sounds</h4>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21624/content_ROLI_Equator2_twist_shape_sound_pluginboutique.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 312px;\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Equator2 has 42 richly detailed, multi-sampled instruments with 220 articulations and variations.

A massive collection of wavetables, multi-samples and granular sources feed the Engines, and every Source Module incorporates its own multimode filter as well as dedicated sends to two further global filters for comprehensive tonal shaping.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Richly Detailed Samples </strong>-<strong> </strong>An integrated library of multi-sampled instruments ranges from vintage synths to the sitar, orchestral strings, and other acoustic instruments. It's accessible through the Sampler Engine, where you can also easily drag and drop your own samples.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Granular Engine</strong> - The Granular Engine slices samples into ‘grains' and helps you tweak their sequential playback, so you can create intriguing soundscapes and textures. Adjust scanning and grain generation rates, grain size and envelope shape, and more. Throw randomization into the mix for a touch – or a fistful – of glitch.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Wavetable Oscillator</strong> - The Wavetable Oscillator Engine is an inexhaustible source of classic analog waveforms, \"designed\" single-cycle waves and complex wavetables. Dial in-depth, edge, and character within the oscillator itself five unison voices, phase distortion, dual-source FM and ring modulation.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Noise Engine</strong> - A dedicated Noise Engine helps you play with noise, that essential component in percussion, pad, lead and other sounds. Choose from Pink, White and Crackle noise profiles, and customize the output with stereo Width and Density controls.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Filters and Saturation</strong> - Equator2 turns the frequency domain into your sound design playground with a dedicated multimode filter built into its six Source Modules, plus two global multimode filters switchable between four routing schemes and up to 12 more filters in the Effects section. Filter modules offer two flavours of distortion: the gentle Saturation mode and the more overtly destructive Wavefolder mode.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Global Routing</strong> - The Routing section in Equator2 allows for extensive and creative signal routing possibilities. Two multi-mode filters per voice with configurable routing allow you to send independent signal amounts through to effects, filters and ring mod to add depth, separation and complexity to your sounds.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Twist and Shape Iconic Sounds</h4>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21624/content_ROLI_Equator2_twist_shape_sound_pluginboutique.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 312px;\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Equator2 has 42 richly detailed, multi-sampled instruments with 220 articulations and variations.

Their new design approach has resulted in the fattest and smoothest self-oscillating digital filter you have ever heard. It has been tuned carefully to achieve the character and warmth of a classic analog synthesizer. FabFilter One’s filter sounds raw but never cheap or ‘digital’, even at full resonance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The filter is fed by an equally high-quality solid-sounding oscillator, developed from scratch to be completely aliasing-free. It features sawtooth, triangle, and square waveforms with pulse width modulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The oscillator and the filter can be modulated by the LFO and the EG. The LFO offers triangle and square wave forms, with adjustable wave balance so any wave form between sawtooth and triangle can be selected. The tempo can be synchronized to the host. The EG has the usual ADSR knobs, but with a perfectly fine-tuned feel. Also, it has an additional Hold setting that extends the time keys are held down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What FabFilter One excels at is the attention to detail and fine-tuning that is visible throughout the plug-in. For example, the portamento feature doesn't just slide from one note to another but uses a carefully selected algorithm to make your playing more lively and give it just that little extra bit of magic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smart Parameter Interpolation handles changes to any of FabFilter One's parameters, ensuring both responsiveness and smooth transitions. There are no annoying digital clicks and zipper effects, and even MIDI controller changes are handled perfectly smooth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Naturally, the FabFilter One plug-in handles all parameter changes at sample accuracy and it can be used with arbitrary sample rates. All parameters are fully automatable within your favourite host and via MIDI Learn. The included help file describes all features of FabFilter One in detail, together with overviews and tutorials to create various types of sounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>... need more options?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Need more sound design options?

Those eternally happy bubblegum sounds made a comeback in the ‘80s in the hands of Blondie, Talking Heads and others, and are still cruising today in retro pop, rock and reggae. The Farfisa V is super simple to use and 147 presets from top sound designers assure that you’ll get right down to rockin’ out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you’re an organist, you’ll love playing this gem.

Combining the unparalleled sound and features of the fabled GX-1 \"Dream Machine\" and its renowned descendant, the CS-80, GX-80 is a transformative virtual synthesizer blending the essence of two groundbreaking instruments to create a powerhouse hybrid. Featuring the carefully crafted and intensely circuit-modeled DSP designs of award-winning developer Mark Barton, Cherry Audio has replicated every subtlety of the classics to create the most authentic emulation of its kind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More than a Replicant</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>GX-80 is not just another CS-80 emulation. GX-80 adeptly reintegrates the GX-1's distinctive features back into the CS-80 architecture, such as dual synth layers for twice the impact and additional waveforms with variable resonators. The GX-1's octave-up triangle wave and invert filter envelope control have been reincorporated. Most notably, GX-80 includes an expert reproduction of the legendary GX-1 filter that delivers exquisite timbres that even the mighty CS-80 cannot produce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For ultimate flexibility and expressive performance, GX-80 provides a split keyboard mode and a brilliant option to simulate polyphonic aftertouch with a monophonic aftertouch controller. With its innovative dual-layer interface, stunning sound presets, and integrated studio-quality effects, GX-80 is more than a best-of-both-worlds interpretation of the past and far more than a replicant. Cherry Audio's GX-80 is an unprecedented gateway to the sounds and music of an unrealized future.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/32995/original_gx-80-ui-02-pluginboutique.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 369px;\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Unobtainium, Until Now</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At last count, only a dozen operating GX-1s have been accounted for, and used CS-80s are rarely listed for less than $60,000. The rarity and exorbitant cost of both instruments has made it impossible for musicians to experience these legendary instruments. That's why Cherry Audio is making its flagship GX-80 synthesizer available at an astounding low price that anyone can afford.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More than the Sum of its Parts</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A virtual reproduction of the CS-80 has long been the most popular request from Cherry Audio users. The company began work in 2021 to make the dream a reality. DSP designer and developer Mark Barton's extensive research of the original CS-80 and its schematics led him back to the CS-80's predecessor. It was determined that this synth would not simply be another CS-80 emulation: it would also reincorporate the extra features of the mighty GX-1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The GX-80 emulates all of the sonic and control characteristics of the originals with unprecedented accuracy. The Cherry Audio team has measured and replicated every subtlety of the classics to create the most authentic emulation of its kind. As a result, GX-80 can produce thicker timbres that more closely match that of the originals. GX-80 models the filter, envelope behavior, portamento and glide, pitch ribbon, and PWM more accurately than any previous emulation.<br>\r\nSingle layer mode allows GX-80 to operate like the standard two-rank CS-80, and the GX-1's two voice ranks are added when the layer mode is set to dual. The GX-1's additional filtered waveform outputs are included, as well as its octave-up triangle wave, invert filter envelope control, and the acclaimed filter topology. All GX-1 parameter sliders and switches are orange to distinguish them from standard CS-80 control parameters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To provide a performance experience as close as possible to the original hardware, GX-80 includes a split keyboard mode and support for both polyphonic and monophonic aftertouch controllers, with a unique \"last-note priority\" mode for simulated poly aftertouch response. With its dual-layer interface, 1,000 stunning sound presets, and integrated studio-quality effects, GX-80 is a singular effort worthy of the \"flagship\" label.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A best-in-class virtual instrument based on two monumental analog classics: the GX-1 and CS-80</li>\r\n\t<li>Reintegrates the extended features of the GX-1 with all of the functionality of its descendant, the CS-80, for an absolutely immense sound experience; essentially, two CS-80s and more!</li>\r\n\t<li>Massive dual-layer voicing architecture with 16 polyphonic voices per layer: two different patches simultaneously playable, in either a keyboard split or stacked layer mode, with discrete controls for layer volume and panning</li>\r\n\t<li>All GX-1 and CS-80 voicing parameters reproduced, including the GX-1's unique oscillator-level filtered waveforms, octave-up triangle wave, and invert filter envelope control</li>\r\n\t<li>Precision recreation of both the legendary CS-80 and unmatched GX-1 filters</li>\r\n\t<li>Four polyphonic voice ranks, each with a voltage-controller oscillator, resonant highpass and lowpass filters, noise generator, sine wave, dual envelope generators, and a velocity-sensitive VCA</li>\r\n\t<li>Sub oscillator LFO for each layer with sine, sawtooth, ramp, square, sample and hold, and noise intended for modulation, with tempo sync</li>\r\n\t<li>Recreation of the memorable CS ring modulator that modulates the summed output of each pair of ranks with its own independent oscillator</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>System Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mac</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>10.13 or above.</li>\r\n\t<li>macOS 13 Ventura supported.</li>\r\n\t<li>64-bit required.</li>\r\n\t<li>Native Apple M1 processor support, including Apple M1 Ultra.</li>\r\n\t<li>3.4 GHz Quad-Core or M1 CPU with 8GB of RAM recommended.</li>\r\n\t<li>Available in AU, VST, VST3, AAX &amp; Standalone formats</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Windows</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Windows 7 or above (including Windows 11), 64-bit required.</li>\r\n\t<li>Quad-core computer with 8GB of RAM recommended.</li>\r\n\t<li>Available in VST, VST3, AAX &amp; Standalone formats</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>"}

The actual guitar player has been transformed into a step sequencer system with a huge level of customisation when it comes to chords or fingering patterns and a detailed control over authentic nuance and expression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Sequencers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/8665/content_block1-image_pluginboutique.jpg\" style=\"height: 400px; width: 600px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Detailed Control and Vast Arrangement Options</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Patterns page in the centre is actually very easy to use. On 16 steps you can determine if a chord is triggered, which strings are played and if the strum goes up- or downward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each string can be played individually at any time, guaranteeing gigantic arpeggios, nuanced metal riffs are also easily done. The damp- and deadnotes make it funky and lively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lower lanes are where you can define the chord sequences. Select a root note, choose one of 12 different chord types, each available in three fingering variations and use the \"step-repeat\" for longer patterns. You can also create up to 24 user chords (incl. impossible chords) by clicking on the fretboard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Human Touch</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/8666/content_block2image_pluginboutique.jpg\" style=\"height: 400px; width: 600px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Busy Fingers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The \"Animations\" page lets you program extra movements for each of the mechanical \"fingers\" on the fretboard. A finger can be moved up or down by one, two or three semitones per step, to enrich chords with harmonic elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The \"Action Section\" offers the means for immediate intervention. Loop parts with a press of a button, include dead- or damp notes, half tempo works as well.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Guitars</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/8667/content_block3-image_pluginboutique.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Four Electric Models with More to Come</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three different guitars are built in: Fender's Stratocaster and Telecaster are included, along with a Duesenberg Starplayer Special. The Starplayer exists in a \"Bright\" and \"Normal\" version.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of these beautiful six-strings was recorded with 2,000 samples. Extensive sets of fretted notes and open strings have been sampled, each one repeated several times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The \"round robin\" function can alternate the playback of different samples. In Random mode, a sample is selected at random from the available pool for the note triggered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Amps and Effects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/8668/content_block4-image_pluginboutique.jpg\" style=\"height: 400px; width: 600px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Form Your Sound</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two effect-units with 10 effects altogether provide the colors you are looking for. FX1 specializes in modulation effects, including a very nice Chorus, a throaty Phaser, and \"Phase Wah\" and \"Auto Wah\" effects. FX2 does classic delays and reverbs, and a reverse‑buffer delay effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two wonderful sounding amp models are available as well as a direct out mode for your favourite amp-emulator-software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And there’s the Wah-Wah pedal. This is more sophisticated than the average guitar stomp-box, with an integral, variable‑rate LFO to sweep the effect back and forth (this can be deactivated, and a MIDI controller assigned for manual control). The LFO can be set to retrigger with input signals above a given threshold (another way of producing \"auto‑wah\" effects), and Max and Min controls allow you to set the upper and lower boundaries of the effects sweep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Clever and Detailed Mechanics</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/8669/content_block5-image_pluginboutique.jpg\" style=\"height: 400px; width: 600px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Feature List Keeps on Giving</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some more features to improve workflow and provide an authentic setup:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Global Strum Speed controllable by host automation</li>\r\n\t<li>Export MIDI sequences to your DAW - can be useful when used to double on another instrument</li>\r\n\t<li>Copy/Paste buttons all over the place for effective composing</li>\r\n\t<li>Detune strings by a semitone using the pegs</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sounds &amp; Presets</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Authentic and Expressive:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Presets are sub-divided into four categories: Global, Sound, Pattern and Chord</li>\r\n\t<li>Sound presets store settings such as the guitar type and selected effects. Pattern presets store the strumming and picking patterns, while Chord presets store chord changes</li>\r\n\t<li>Selecting a Global preset automatically loads the matching presets in the other three categories. However, you can mix and match the different categories, combining the chord progression from one preset with the picking from another, and the effects settings from still another</li>\r\n\t<li>User presets of all four types can be created and saved</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Four electric Guitars with more to come soon</li>\r\n\t<li>More than 2,000 Samples for each Sixstring</li>\r\n\t<li>Control over Strum, Chords &amp; Song Structures</li>\r\n\t<li>Action Section for real-time Control</li>\r\n\t<li>Slides, Vibratos or Portamentos</li>\r\n\t<li>Warm Amps and Direct-Out</li>\r\n\t<li>10 Effects plus Wahwah Pedal &amp; Talk mode</li>\r\n\t<li>Mute or De-tune individual Strings</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>System Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Mac</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>macOS 10.12 or higher <strong>(Apple Silicon M1 supported) (64-bit only)</strong>\n</li>\r\n\t<li>VST2, VST3, AU, AAX &amp; Standalone Application</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Windows</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Windows 7 or higher <strong>(64-bit only)</strong>\n</li>\r\n\t<li>VST2, VST3, AAX &amp; Standalone Application</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Important note: </strong>This software is only available in 64-bit format for both Windows and macOS and will not function on 32-bit systems.</p>\r\n</div>"}

Using techniques similar to those found in additive synthesis, each Harmonia oscillator can simultaneously produce up to eight pitches, individually tuned to a harmonic series or semitones. The volume for each pitch harmonic can be fixed or dynamic, and Harmonia’s unique interpolated harmonic scanning enables dramatic sweeps and melodious sequences through a single modulatable slider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harmonia derives its distinctive organic sound from hundreds of sampled waveforms recorded from various synthesizers, traditional instruments and voices, colorful “lo-fi” sounds, and more. User samples can be imported, further expanding Harmonia’s tonal palette. Producers can effortlessly create unique morphed and sequencer-like tones by varying the combinations of waveform selection and harmonic presets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harmonia reaches new heights by providing four syncable LFOs, an expansive multimode filter, click-and-drag envelopes, and a massive mod matrix with eight slots for dozens of sources and destinations. Harmonia includes support for aftertouch, flexible MIDI mapping, and a collection of over 350 breathtaking, professionally designed presets.

Add movement and life using the shape sequencer, or instantly record, rotate and arpeggiate note sequences. The 12-slot matrix even lets you modulate effect parameters, encouraging you to explore a whole new world of creative options. With its swappable audio engine, flexible signal routing, wavetable support and quality effects, Hive 2 makes sure you can get the sound you want with a minimum of fuss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wavetables - How It Works</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hive 2 includes Wavetables! These appear as multiple waveforms and are controlled in the central hexagon. You can manually select wavetables, modulate the wave position via the matrix, or even scan through them automatically using the envelope and loop options (which let you animate wavetables without the need for an extra modulation source).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This panel also offers a Reverse option to flip the wavetable back to front, Cyclic mode for seamless wavetable cycling, and various real-time interpolation methods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Multi-Table</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wavetables can be split into multiple parts (up to 16), effectively creating a 2-dimensional oscillator. For instance, a wavetable with 30 frames can be split into 3 x 10 frames by setting Tables to 3. The lower Position knob will crossfade between those 3. This feature opens up a second dimension of wavetable scanning, such as velocity crossfade or multisample support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UHM scripting</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Want to go even deeper? Many of Hive's factory wavetables are not samples, but \".uhm\" files containing scripts written in a proprietary wavetable generation and manipulation language. If you're interested in writing your own scripts, grab this document (also included in the Hive installer).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Interpolation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hive provides 4 different algorithms for interpolating between wavetable frames: switch, crossfade, spectral, or zero phase. The appearance (and CPU usage) of waveforms can differ significantly, depending on the chosen interpolation. The spectral and zero phase modes shift the relative phases of partials differently, while the switch option only shows non-interpolated waveforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Low CPU usage, 3 different synth engines</li>\r\n\t<li>2 oscillators with standard waveforms or 2D wavetables, up to 16x unison, tunable sub-oscillators</li>\r\n\t<li>Drag &amp; drop modulation assignment</li>\r\n\t<li>12 x 2 modulation matrix slots with modifiers for curvature, rectification, quantization, sample &amp; hold, slew rate</li>\r\n\t<li>4 user-definable XY control pads</li>\r\n\t<li>Unique 8-step shape sequencer with 4 independent outputs</li>\r\n\t<li>Arpeggiator, step sequencer with real-time recording</li>\r\n\t<li>Scale quantizer with a pre-defined list of scales</li>\r\n\t<li>2 function generators which can serve as extra envelopes, gate generators, LFOs, slew limiters</li>\r\n\t<li>7 rearrangeable effects: distortion, chorus, delay, phaser, EQ, reverb, compressor</li>\r\n\t<li>Panel presets for oscillators, filters, envelopes, LFOs, sequencer, FX and modulation matrix</li>\r\n\t<li>Solo buttons let you audition individual oscillators and filters during sound design</li>\r\n\t<li>Scope to view the audio output or any modulation signal, with freeze option and zoom controls</li>\r\n\t<li>Microtuning support (.tun files)</li>\r\n\t<li>2400+ NKS-ready factory presets by some of u-he's favourite sound designers.</li>\r\n\t<li>Resizable UI from 70% to 200%</li>\r\n\t<li>Alternative Izmo skin</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>More Features...</h4>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Shape Sequencer</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The Shape Sequencer is where you can create complex modulations and/or rhythmic patterns, it offers a comfortable way to 'gamify' rhythm creation. The shape sequencer has four Shape Modulator lanes (A, B, C and D), each with an independent set of options determining how the active cells in that lane are sequenced: This means that the shape modulators can be triggered differently and run at different speeds! While it may look like a baby version of what other synths have to offer, Hive's shape sequencer can do a lot more than first meets the eye…</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Function Generators</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hive’s Function Generators combine simple envelope functionality with LFO, slew limiter (a.k.a. envelope follower) and gate control. Each of the three outputs has its own ‘crosshair’ you can drag &amp; drop onto any modulation target, onto the Scope or even onto the modulation matrix source fields. Triggered and/or modulated by the LFOs, the Shape Sequencer and each other, Hive’s Function Generators can create some truly mind-bending motion effects!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Arpeggiator and Sequencer</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ARP/SEQ panel in the central hexagon is where you make rhythmic and melodic loops.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Arpeggiator </strong>- You can select up to 3 octaves range, 6 different direction options, and 4 for the order. Additional features are Restart, which sets the number of notes the arpeggiator will play before jumping back to the beginning, and ClockDiv, which slows the arpeggiator down relative to the sequencer.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Sequencer </strong>- The sequencer has 2 different modes, one of which lets you send control signals (CC) without triggering any notes. Like the arpeggiator, the sequence will run whenever one or more notes are played and will stop when all notes are released. In record (REC) mode you can enter individual notes on your keyboard or even capture the output of the arpeggiator.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Flexible Effects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hive's hexagon includes 7 different effects: Distortion, Reverb, Equalizer, Chorus, Delay, Compressor, and Phaser.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Enable and Rearrange</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The on/off status and position of each effect in the chain is controlled using the central column: Click once to enable or disable an effect, and drag up and down to rearrange. This ease of use invites experimental combinations e.g. short reverb into highly resonant phaser into heavy distortion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Edit and Modulate</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Effects in Hive are fully-featured with many editable controls, a selection of presets, and the well known u-he quality.

Every control you see can be modulated in the modulation matrix – even a few you can't see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Modulation Matrix</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hive features a 12-unit modulation matrix (6 units per page) which lets you connect modulation sources (LFOs, envelopes, shape sequencer, MIDI controls etc.) to countless targets, optionally via a second modulation source. 2 targets can be assigned per unit, each with its own modulatable depth control. The row of 5 modifiers per target can alter the curvature, rectify, quantize, sample/hold or slew-limit the modulation signal: This is seriously deep stuff, but it doesn't get in the way!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Performance Controls</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On this page you'll find a pad with 4 controls – simply connect them to your MIDI controllers for maximum fun on stage. Other views are also available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Automatic Parameter Scanning</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hive is able to assign XY controls to parameters automatically. It looks into the structure of presets that have unused XY controls, and assigns them to the most appropriate XY macros (pre-defined sets of parameters). Of course, you can create your own XY control definitions, with up to 4 targets per dimension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Scope</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Animated graphics in software synthesizers not only look cool but can also help you program your sounds by showing you what’s happening in real-time. Hive’s Scope is especially useful for displaying how the parts of complex modulation interact (e.g. the Function Generators with an LFO).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Izmo Skin</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hive 2.1 includes a brand new alternative skin called Izmo, created by the very talented GUI designer Yuta Yoshimatsu (a.k.a. Plugmon Link).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Izmo offers a fresh new look and workflow, letting you explore and experience Hive as if it were a radically different synth, sparking your creativity in exciting new ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To enable Izmo, simply right-click anywhere in the background of Hive's window and select it from the pop-up menu.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/22708/content_uhe-hive2-screenshot-izmo-1000x680_pluginboutique.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 340px;\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>System Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Mac</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Mac OS X 10.9 or newer <strong>(Intel and M1 Mac Supported) (64-bit only)</strong>\n</li>\r\n\t<li>AU2, VST2, VST3</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Windows</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Windows 7 or newer <strong>(32 / 64-bit)</strong>\n</li>\r\n\t<li>VST2, VST3</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Minimum Requirements</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Host software / DAW</li>\r\n\t<li>1GB RAM, more recommended</li>\r\n\t<li>50MB free disk space</li>\r\n\t<li>1000 × 600 or larger display</li>\r\n\t<li>Modern CPU required</li>\r\n\t<li>Intel Nehalem or newer, AMD Bulldozer or newer (for Windows / Linux)</li>\r\n\t<li>Intel Nehalem or newer, Apple M1 (for Mac)</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Linux</strong> - glibc version 2.28 or newer</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Plugin Formats:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Hive 2 is not a standalone product, it requires host software.

{"title": "Hybrid 3", "brand": "AIR Music Technology", "url": "/product/1-Instruments/4-Synth/1545-Hybrid-3", "rating": 5.0, "description": "<div itemprop=\"description\">\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align:center\">The Next Generation in Synthesis</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Hybrid 3.0 is the next generation in synthesis. This high-definition virtual synthesizer combines the coveted warmth of analog synths with a full range of futuristic digital manipulation capabilities. The result is the best of both worlds — a virtual instrument with a comprehensive set of precisely adjustable parameters that can sound like a synth you remember or something no one has ever heard before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1200+ Built-In Sounds</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hybrid 3.0 comes with over 1,200 inspirational presets designed to jumpstart the creative process. Over 200 new patches, designed by the acclaimed AIR sound designers, include everything from wobbles, synth pads, arpeggios, poly synths, basses, leads, sequences, and much more. Hybrid veterans will be pleased to find that the familiar Hybrid 2.0 presets have been completely reworked, allowing users to experience their favorite sounds with all the sonic improvements of Hybrid 3.0. If you’re prone to tweaking, Hybrid 3.0 is loaded with a comprehensive set of user-adjustable parameters that let you create unique sounds and fine-tune them to taste. With support for two simultaneous parts (i.e. a powerful combination of two separate, 3-oscillator synthesizers), you can layer, split, or spread sounds to produce deep, complex, and wide patches. Plus, the simple patch browser makes it easy to find the preset you’re looking for and allows you to load two presets simultaneously, one into each part, for experimenting with rich timbres and playing multi-patch sounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>High-Definition Oscillators</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With three versatile oscillators and a sub oscillator per part, Hybrid 3.0 is capable of stacking multiple oscillators together for huge pads, leads, basses, and more. Two multifunctional oscillators can recreate the classic subtractive-synthesis waveforms for a dose of analog nostalgia. In addition, these oscillators feature algorithms for digital wavetables. As a result, users can choose from nine different modes, including the Multi-Square waveform, Saw Sync, Saw Cross Modulation (which modulates the pitch of a saw wave with the output of a triangle wave for complex tones), Saw Multi (a stack of seven saws in unison), Square Sync, Square Cross Modulation, Square Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), and Wavetable. Hybrid 3.0 offers 100 wavetables with up to 64 single-cycle waveforms each. A third oscillator includes saw, square, or triangle waves, plus a noise generator and a sub oscillator for deep bass effects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dual Filtering and Saturation Modes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hybrid 3.0 features two multi-mode filters that can run in series or in parallel. In addition, the filters can be assigned one per channel to the stereo outputs, or set so that Oscillator 1 feeds Filter 1, with the remaining Oscillators being routed to Filter 2. Both of the filters offer your choice of DCF (Digitally Controlled Filter) or VCF models. The vintage Voltage Controlled Filter (VCF) makes it easier than ever to achieve those fat, retro synth sounds of the ’70s and ’80s. This sound filter brings the legendary soft and fat warmth of classic analog synth hardware filters to Hybrid 3.0.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use the revolutionary multimode filters to control the tone color of a part by removing or accenting certain frequencies. Choose from an extensive collection of 23 modes. Then dial in the filter cut-off, velocity, and key tracking. Use the resonance dial to change the tone from a nasal sound to a ringing tone by emphasizing frequencies around the cut-off and generating self-oscillation. A blend of the third oscillator and noise generator can serve as an audio modulation source for filter cut-off, producing distinctive electronic audio effects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To add some serious edge, adjust the filter saturation. Hybrid 3.0 offers the original Overdrive filter, which creates a soft tube-like clipping and includes five additional filter saturation modes: Distort, which creates a harder, brighter clipping; Hard Clip, which creates a very hard and bright transistor-like clipping; Rectify, which creates a gentle distortion that retains the character of the input signal; Bit Crush, which creates deliberate aliasing by reducing the bit depth; and Resample, which creates deliberate aliasing by reducing the sample rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>LFOs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hybrid 3.0 includes four LFOs per part: two monophonic, one polyphonic, and one special Pump LFO. Use the LFOs to modulate pitch, loudness, or cut-off to produce vibrato, tremolo, or electronic sweeps. Choose from eight modulation types, ranging from sine and triangle waves to random, “drift,” and sample-and-hold modulation. Change the depth, rate, phase, and sync mode to quickly and dramatically alter the sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pump is a special type of envelope that simulates studio side-chaining to create the pumping-and-breathing effect. In the case of Hybrid 3.0, this rhythmic effect can be applied to much more than the overall mix. The Pump LFO can be routed to create a rhythmic effect on a variety of specific parameters, such as pitch or filter settings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Envelope Editors</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use the four envelope editors to easily sculpt the filter, amplitude, and any two other modulation envelopes. Adjust velocity, attack, decay, and key tracking, and then type in the envelope rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hype Algorithm</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>New to Hybrid 3.0 is Hype, a quick way of enhancing the low- or high- end of any patch. Beef up wobbles, basses, and kick-drum sounds with deep, sub-bass by adjusting the Hype Low parameter, or turn up Hype High to polish off the high end with shimmer and sparkle; the latter sounds great on pads, strings, brass, and percussive sounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Doubling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hybrid 3.0 offers a new way of making your patches sound enormous. Two Doubling knobs, one for each part, are built into the Common tab for additional widening and thickening. Turn up the Doubling knobs to full for a dramatic response or mix it in subtly for a slight thickening effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Performance-Oriented Features</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you use it in the studio or in a live situation, Hybrid 3.0 is built to perform. Use the step sequencers for arpeggiation or phrase generation. Set the modulation matrix to easily map modulations from sources to destinations. And set up “morph” groups to modify sounds on the fly, from the interface or a MIDI controller.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step Sequencers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hybrid 3.0’s onboard 16-step sequencers have been revamped for more programming and sequencing flexibility. Now, steps can be linked together to vary sequencer rhythm, manipulate note dynamics, and create advanced modulation patterns. Like before, both step sequencers can function as a composition tool or an extra modulation source, making it easy to create patches that move and evolve. You can set note values, velocity, and modulation, and then pick from nine playback options to use the sequencer as a step sequence, arpeggiator, or MIDI phrase generator. Plus, you can even import your own MIDI phrases for complete customization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Modulation Matrices</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hybrid 3.0 also offers flexible and easy-to-use modulation matrices with 16 assignable modulation sources and more than 20 destinations each. Assign modulations to an oscillator or filter. Hybrid 3.0 allows multiple assignments of sources and destinations, all with adjustable intensities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Morph Groups</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Hybrid 3.0, you can assign any rotary control or fader on the plugin’s interface to one of the four “morph” groups. Assign pan, filter, or amplifier envelopes to a morph group to alter sounds from your controller while recording or playing live. Each morph group can control several parameters simultaneously. You, in turn, can control morph groups from the dials on the interface or from a MIDI controller.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Effects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hybrid 3.0 provides two insert effect sends per part, each with more than 40 effect types, so you can quickly change the sound of a part. A separate master effects section lets you select reverb, delay, and chorus effects to enhance — or warp — any of the sounds at the patch level. Easily adjust effect parameters and sync effects to a chosen tempo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Seamless DAW Integration</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hybrid 3.0 is available in VST and AAX plugin formats for both 32- and 64-bit operating systems and in AU for 64-bit operating systems. With its rich set of analog and digital sounds and a large array of adjustable parameters, Hybrid 3.0 gives musicians, arrangers, composers, and sound designers the qualities and character of a unique hardware synthesizer with the convenience and flexibility of an integrated plugin.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features:</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Six-oscillator subtractive and wavetable virtual synthesizer with 1200+ inspiring presets.</li>\r\n\t<li>Includes 200+ all-new sounds and 1000+ refreshed patches from Hybrid 2.0.</li>\r\n\t<li>Comprised of two simultaneous parts, each loaded with 3 oscillators and a sub-oscillator, filters, LFOs, envelopes, and effects for creating complex patches.</li>\r\n\t<li>All-new Doubling controls for quickly thickening and widening patches.</li>\r\n\t<li>Revamped step sequencers allow you to link steps together for rhythmic variation, syncopation, and advanced modulation patterns.</li>\r\n\t<li>All-new Oscillator Restart for punchy bass sounds, runs, and sequences.</li>\r\n\t<li>Dual series or parallel filters with vintage Voltage Controlled Filter modes for retro synth sounds.</li>\r\n\t<li>Flexible modulation options with 8 LFOs including Pump for the pumping-and-breathing effect.</li>\r\n\t<li>Comprehensive editing parameters for the ultimate in sound tweakability.</li>\r\n\t<li>Sample-accurate synthesis for super-fast envelopes and high-definition sound.</li>\r\n\t<li>Performance-driven features, including modulation matrices and multiple step sequencers for maximum playability.</li>\r\n\t<li>Available in VST and AAX plugin formats for both 32- and 64-bit operating systems and in AU for 64-bit operating systems.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Expansion Packs (sold separately)</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/product/70-Expansion-Packs/1644-Mark-Knight-Expansion-for-Hybrid-3\">Mark Knight</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/product/70-Expansion-Packs/1645-Rene-Amesz-Expansion-for-Hybrid-3\">Rene Amesz</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/product/70-Expansion-Packs/1646-D-Ramirez-Expansion-for-Hybrid-3\">D.Ramirez</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/product/70-Expansion-Packs/1647-Tocadisco-Expansion-for-Hybrid-3\">Tocadisco</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/product/70-Expansion-Packs/1648-Marco-Lys-Expansion-for-Hybrid-3\">Marco Lys</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>System Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mac: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>macOS X 10.10 - macOS 11 Big Sur <strong>(Full Apple silicon (M1) support is not available, but the VST plugin may be compatible with some DAWs if run using Rosetta)</strong>\n</li>\r\n\t<li>Core Duo Processor (Core i5 or i7 Recommended)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PC:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Windows 10, 8 or Windows 7 Service Pack 1</li>\r\n\t<li>Minimum Dual Core 2GHz (Intel Core i5 or i7 Recommended)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Formats</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>VST <strong>(32 bit and 64 bit) </strong>qualified for:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>All popular hosts supported</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>AU <strong>(64 bit only)</strong> qualified for:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Logic Pro X</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>AAX qualified for:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>ProTools 10.3 (32 bit), ProTools 11.x (64 bit), ProTools 12 and ProTools 2020</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Please Note: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Minimum RAM 4GB (8GB or more recommended)</li>\r\n\t<li>200MB free hard drive space required (Download and Installation)</li>\r\n\t<li>Internet Access required (Download and Authorization)</li>\r\n\t<li>A <a href=\"http://www.ilok.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">FREE iLok account &amp; Licence Manager</a> is required to authorise this software (a physical USB iLok is not required).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Important note: </strong><strong>An internet connection is required to authorise this software.</strong></p>\r\n</div>"}

{"title": "ImPerfect 1.6", "brand": "W. A. Production", "url": "/product/1-Instruments/4-Synth/5996-ImPerfect-1-6", "rating": 4.0, "description": "<div itemprop=\"description\"><h4 style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/17900/content_imperfect-logo-pluginboutique.jpg\" style=\"height:115px; width:400px\"></h4>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align:center\">Special Shifting Synth</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most digital synths out there offer easily accessible functions, pristine digital quality and precisely tuned tones. “Imperfect” aims to break that trend with wavering detuned oscillators, modulating effects and a whole host of other functions designed to put the analogue fun back into synth programming. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The architecture behind Imperfect will be familiar to anyone who’s used a soft-synth before, with 5 powerful oscillators, envelopes, filters, LFOs and an arpeggiator. Where things start to get interesting is with the 3 special modulation sliders. Named “Wacky”, “Cracky” and “Shaky”, these functions introduce modulated effects, saturated harmonics and tuning inconsistencies. Make your pads sound authentically analogue and keep your arpeggios moving by adjusting these sliders to create all sorts of circuit-bending scenarios. The modulations don’t stop there; almost any of Imperfect’s parameters can be assigned to the constantly shifting dual X/Y pads and played live or programmed with MIDI automation. </p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/17901/content_imperfect-3d-pluginboutique.jpg\" style=\"height:260px; width:600px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5 Oscillator Modules</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mix 5 different oscillators to create the basis of your sound. Oscillators 1 and 2 can each be morphed between 4 different waveforms, then layer up a sampled waveform, sub-oscillator and noise profile. Ring and Frequency modulation can easily be dialled in, along with octave, detune and pulse width settings. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>260 Waveforms or Load Your Own</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Preset waveforms can be loaded into oscillator 3 and there are 260 different ones to choose from. If you still feel limited then don’t worry, just load your own WAV file into Imperfect and then use the processing power to transform it into a totally different sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Catch the Drift</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wacky, Cracky and Shaky sliders dictate the amount of analogue-style processing that Imperfect performs. “Wacky” increases the amount of the 3 effects (phaser / chorus / delay) to push the tone into drifting and delayed space. “Cracky” pushes up the saturation level to introduce harmonics and dirty up the signal. “Shaky” modulates the tune from subtle detuning at low levels to full-on pitch modulation when pushed harder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dual X/Y Modulation Pads</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not one, but two X/Y pads can be assigned to a total of four different parameters and then be automated or played live. 3 different performance modes are available to automatically twist your timbres into unrecognisable shapes. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Visual Feedback</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The central scope accurately displays the waveform you’re creating, along with left and right channel output meters. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Full Synth Controls</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the functions you’d expect of a plugin synth are present and correct within Imperfect, including filter module, dual envelopes, two low-frequency oscillators and an effects section. There’s no compromise to functionality or performance with Imperfect. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Arpeggiator</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Set Imperfect to Arp mode for up to 4 octave automatic arpeggiation. Rate can be synced to your host BPM at a variety of note intervals, or you can set it to free running. Latch or unlatch the arp function with the selector switch. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Global Parameters</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imperfect features all the standard global controls you’d expect from a quality synth plugin. Set the global tuning and glide timing. Choose mono or poly modes up to 16 voices. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Presets</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Including hundreds of expertly programmed factory presets, Imperfect has an onboard browser where you can audition sounds prior to loading. You’re sure to find the perfect starting point for your own creations and they’re easy to save and recall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forgot about static synth sounds and venture into the world of valves and resistors with Imperfect’s vintage-sounding processing. Never look back, unless that’s the sound you want!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>W. A. Production are real-life producers making creative plugins to help you achieve studio quality processing quickly and easily.

Modelled on the legendary Juno-6, its immediate colossal sound remains awe-inspiring to this day - optimized and enhanced for the modern music maker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jun-6 V combines beautiful polysynth thickness with an ultra-easy interface to satisfy your analogue needs from the very first note. Its simple controls, accessible creative features, and modern enhancements make it an essential keyboard that you’ll just keep coming back to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chords that'll shake the foundations, textures that'll illuminate the sky, and unison bass that'll leave your audience speechless. When you want instant mix-filling analogue fatness, Jun-6 V is the answer. Your ticket to no-nonsense ‘80s synth glory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Polyphony to the Masses</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jun-6 V's hardware predecessor was released at a time when a polyphonic synth was a luxury. Many consider the Juno series to have struck a rare and perfect balance when it comes to synthesizer design. Their ease of use, vivid analogue sound, and relative affordability helped put the coveted multi-voiced within reach of a bigger audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Pure Analogue Spirit</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The Juno synths were notoriously easy to use - Jun-6 V is no different. From the minute you open it up, you’ll be in familiar synthesis territory, from the simplicity of DCOs to the instant stereo glory of BBD chorus. Dial-in a dynamite sound that’s true to the original in no time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Voice Calibration</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To bring you the authentic Juno experience, Arturia even went to the lengths of offering different levels of analogue voice dispersion. Subtle variations in condition and voltage sometimes meant that each voice was very slightly different, from filter cutoff to VCA envelope attack. Choose a level of analogue drift to suit your taste - squeaky clean, rough around the edges, or somewhere in the middle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Back to the Arpeggiator</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jun-6 V takes the classic arpeggiator formula back to basics, so you can instantly weave driving hypnotic patterns on the fly, just like the good old days. Put aside complex multi-mode arp algorithms - simplicity and musicality is the aim of the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21872/content_test3.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 538px;\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Double-barrelled filter</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are filters, and there are filters. Jun-6 V perfectly emulates the simple yet refined sculpting capabilities of its ‘80s ancestor. Go for bubbling low-pass warmth, dynamic high-pass tension, or a combination of the two.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Let’s Talk About Chorus</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The classic dual chorus that’s almost as famous as the synthesizers it's synonymous with. Jun-6 V’s chorus boasts the same authentic BBD character and subtle stereo spread for an irresistibly warm cinematic sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21873/content_test2.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 503px;\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Complex, Meet Simple</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The Juno 6 was renowned for its simplicity. Meticulously-modeled DCOs (digitally controlled oscillators) kept everything in tune, with a dynamite blend of square, ramp, sub, and noise. Your sound was shaped by a simple but effective twin filter setup. Add an LFO, an ADSR envelope, and a 3-mode stereo chorus, and you’ve got yourself a Juno.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21874/content_Screenshot_2020-12-09_164556.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 144px;\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Enhanced Expression, Enhanced Performance</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Jun-6 V is a hands-on, express-yourself kinda synthesizer, with an irresistible sound that begs to be played over and over - it doesn’t end there though. Arturia have expanded this polysynth icon with just enough extra modulation &amp; FX tricks to enhance its sound without compromising its signature tactile simplicity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Modwheel, Velocity &amp; Aftertouch</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the Modwheel, tweak the LFO intensity for the DCO and/or VCF, or assign to a destination of your choice. Assign Velocity or AfterTouch to a modulation destination of your choice for dynamic movement that responds to every touch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Expanded Modulation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One envelope has become two, and a second multi-waveform LFO has been added to the mix. The second ADSR envelope features two freely assignable destinations, as does LFO 2. Perfectly accessible modulation that adds just enough movement without detracting from Jun-6 V’s hands-on playability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Chord Mode</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>transform every note into a full-sounding chord, and choose from 12 voicings including your own custom voicing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bender &amp; Unison</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exactly what you think it is. Again, hardwired to the DCO and VCF for instant pitch bends and dynamic build-ups. Unison assigns multiple voices to a single note for condensed fatness, perfect for pumping bass arps or red-hot leads - choose your density and detune to taste.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Delay &amp; Reverb</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the FX front, you’ll find some additional spacious reverb and delay. This simple addition takes Jun-6 V’s unmistakably vintage sound and sets it up for contemporary application. Cinematic ambience, stadium-sized pop chords, and bouncing trap lead lines are all within reach.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/24541/content_content_advanced-big_pluginboutique.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 227px;\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>What Else?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TAE® Powered</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>TAE® \"True Analog Emulation\" is Arturia's exclusive technology that accurately reproduces the defining sonic qualities of analogue synthesizers.

Rebuilt from scratch, this dream synthesizer goes beyond authentic with an earth-shaking sound fused with expansive sound design flexibility and channels the unmistakably awe-inspiring polysynth power of the iconic Jupiter-8. From fluorescent ‘80s pads to dancing modulated arps, it’s hard to think of a classic synth sound that this analogue powerhouse can't do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Managing to be simultaneously fat, airy and crystal clear, Jup-8 V uses Arturia's unrivalled analogue modelling technology to deliver the full head-turning sound that defined - and continues to define - countless records. Not only that; Arturia have turned up the heat on this giant, combining it with dynamic modern features that’ll take your sonic voyage further than ever before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Return of a Giant</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many consider the Jupiter-8 to be the greatest synthesizer ever made. Introduced in 1981, it was Japan’s answer to the American-dominated synth market - heads were turned. For synth enthusiasts, professional hitmakers, and performing keyboardists alike, the Jupiter-8 truly raised the bar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its extensive feature-set, from keyboard splitting to intricate modulation, was considered years ahead of its time - and it quickly became something of a household name in the synthesizer world.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/5075/content_jup-8v-01-pluginboutique.jpg\" style=\"height:338px; width:800px\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>All-powerful Then, All-powerful Now</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jup-8 V restores this peerless icon to its former glory, painstakingly emulated down to the finest detail. Enjoy that hairs-on-end sound and a classic hands-on synth workflow that’s inspired countless musicians over the decades. Component-level modelling meets an authentic slider-based interface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Jupiter voice took audiences’ collective breath away in the ‘80s and still does to this day. Its enormous flexibility and larger-than-life stereo sound made waves - but its true power was in its 16-oscillator voice architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jup-8 V puts this unstoppable analogue power at your fingertips, in spectacularly colourful detail.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21847/content_main_%281%29.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 405px;\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>VCOs with Character</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not just 2 oscillators per voice; 2 oscillators with their own distinct characters per voice. These characters let you switch between using fine-tuning, a noise waveform, octave ranges, switchable sync - the list goes on. These ultra-simple VCO controls offer an explosion of timbral possibilities, just like the original.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>An LFO You Can Count On</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It does what it says on the tin - a simple monophonic LFO for when you need things to rumble, shake, wobble, and weave. 4 shapes, tempo sync, with a little bit of delay and optional retrig to make it sit right where your song needs it to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>VCO Modulation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ask anyone what features they loved about the Jupiter synthesizers, and ‘cross-modulation’ will likely be a hot topic. Jup-8 V delivers the goods. Dial-in basic VCO frequency modulation to taste, 3 modes of pulse-width modulation, or go full cross-mod for those dynamite sci-fi sweeps straight out of a John Carpenter movie.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21846/content_main-left.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 443px;\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Twin Envelope Generators</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Employ Jup-8 V’s 2 x ADSR envelope generators for shaping your voice and sprinkling sonic variation that responds to every note you play. The controls in each section let you dial in however much ENV modulation you feel like:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>ENV 1 can modulate the VCO pitch, PWM and VCF cutoff</li>\r\n\t<li>ENV 2 can modulate the VCO pitch, VCF cutoff, and VCA level</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>No menu-diving, no complex patching. These envelopes don’t mess about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>VCF or HPF?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tame those planet-sized analogue oscillators with a dual filter configuration that proved so popular, it continued appearing in Roland synthesizers for years after the Jupiter-8’s release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enjoy spine-tingling sweeps and bubbling bass thanks to a resonant low pass VCF, with a separate hi-pass filter to smooth out your low end. Of course, Jup-8 V’s filter section wouldn’t be complete without some hefty modulation to play with. Get that filter in line with your performance with LFO, ENV and keyboard control.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21848/content_main-right.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 443px;\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Stack &amp; Spread</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you’ve got a single note stacked 8 voices high, the fatness is undeniable. But when you need that extra oomph factor, Unison Detune is your secret weapon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Voice Dispersion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes it’s the smallest imperfections that make the biggest difference. Introducing Voice Dispersion, a detailed emulation of the naturally-occurring voltage variations that give these analogue relics so much character.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Express Yourself</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Add ghost notes and semitone glides to taste with Jup-8 V’s Bender, routed directly to either VCO, or both at once.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Arpeggiator</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The humble arpeggiator is as much a part of the familiar classic synth sound as an analogue oscillator. Jup-8 V brings the simplicity of the Jupiter-8’s instant-access arpeggiator and boosts it with extra modes and tempo sync.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21849/content_bottom.jpg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 226px;\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>What's New?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes the nostalgic immersion and raw power of a vintage synthesizer is all you crave. But sometimes, you can’t help but think… \"...what if?\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What if your analogue polysynth had more than 1 LFO to push its sound design capabilities further? What if you could combine the gratifying playability of a classic keyboard with the cutting-edge flexibility of a modulation step-sequencer? What if you could instantly combine organic VCO warmth with crystal-clear digital FX in a single instrument?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Jup-8 V, there are no ‘what ifs’.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21850/content_new.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 328px;\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Modulation that Goes Further</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No emulation would be complete without the modulation capabilities of Jup-8 V’s hardware ancestor - but Arturia took it a step further with 2 additional complex LFOs and a complex Modulation Mixer for more sonic variation than you can shake a stick at.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Next-level Sequencing</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jup-8 V comes armed with 2 x 32-step sequencers for Notes and Modulation respectively. Better still, both of these sequencers have been enhanced in parallel, with simplified sync options, independent sequence lengths, intuitive pitch values, scales, and more - simply giving you greater control when constructing musical ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21851/content_seq.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 190px;\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Keyboard Expressivity</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Jup-8 V, the keyboard does more than play notes.<br>\r\nThe Advanced panel also conceals in-depth controls that let you harness the keyboard response for your own creative purposes. This detailed 4-part section allows you to program Velocity, Aftertouch, Keyboard Tracking, and Modwheel information to affect up to 3 destinations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Craft your own curves, personalize your dynamic response, and wire any aspect of Jup-8 V to respond to every note that plays - you’re in control.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21852/content_keyb.jpg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 191px;\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Digital FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the iconic power of the Jupiter sound lies in its unique voice architecture and modulation flexibility, a little FX never hurt anyone. Does Jup-8 V need 11 new FX to sound great? No. Does it sound absolutely mind-blowing with them added to the mix? Without a doubt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Send your pads echoing around moon craters, or bathe them in a tide of rich analogue chorus. Crush your basslines with digital grit, or slam them with heavy compression for old-school tightness. 3 FX slots, configurable in series or parallel, with 11 FX to choose from… that’s 11 new ways to take this classic sound to another level.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21853/content_fx.jpg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 190px;\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A New Sound Engine</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jup-8 V’s new sound engine was totally rebuilt using the latest DSP technology to ensure that this virtual instrument is as authentic as it is powerful, as stable and reliable as it is sincerely imperfect. From subtle analogue voice dispersions to the meticulously replicated filter section, this faithful reimagining is as close to the real thing as it gets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What Else?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TAE® Powered</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>TAE® \"True Analog Emulation\" is Arturia's exclusive technology that accurately reproduces the defining sonic qualities of analogue synthesizers.

It was one of the synths that defined the sound of the 1980s and was used on countless hits by artists such as The Eurythmics, Cyndi Lauper, and Aha. Now it’s loved more than ever and used on hits by acts like Charlie Puth, Tame Impala, and the Weeknd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sweet Dreams</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now AIR Music bring you something very special, the authentic sound of that 80s synth, meticulously recreated.

You can really get your hands on this vintage classic and craft your future hits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Take On Me</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course you get all the analogue goodness of the original, their team are audio wizards and they have meticulously crafted the sound. It has the single DCO, a monster sub oscillator, the unparalleled VCF, and if you want it, lashings of THAT chorus!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They’ve offered two workflows; the original front panel design, plus an extended modern UI that gives you even more ways to tweak the sound. There’s some audio extras under the hood. The VCF includes saturation and drive and there’s also two DCO noise types; modern and vintage. There’s a second envelope, not found on the original, to help you further craft the perfect sound.In addition to the chorus, there’s a powerful delay, reverb, and EQ circuit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Time After Time</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, Jura gives you the best of both worlds - the classic sound of an ‘80s synth monster, coupled with some very cool modern workflow enhancements.

It starts with a hybrid engine that features dual oscillators with a wide variety of sources – including virtual analogue, FM, phase distortion, waveshaping, ring modulation, cross modulation, and lo-fi – all of them running at double the system sample rate for the highest possible quality. Together with a state-variable filter, Odds offers a total of 80 different configurations, covering a huge spectrum of sounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the “stochastic control” part is what takes this plugin to an entirely new level: for every note played, Odds has variable trigger probability, selectable pitch transpose randomization patterns, plus further independent randomization of up to 4 additional synth engine parameters. These advanced features make it possible to create extremely complex, never-repeating melodic and tonal variations even out of the most basic note sequences. Add to this a highly flexible modulation generator with a multitude of envelope and LFO shapes – and, right within your existing device, you have the synthesis power and sophistication that can rival a small modular system.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Odds plugin in prologue, minilogue xd, and NTS-1 formats</li>\r\n\t<li>40 presets for prologue, 35 presets for minilogue xd, and 35 presets for NTS-1 (in the form of preset tables)</li>\r\n\t<li>User Manual PDF</li>\r\n\t<li>Preset Tables PDF</li>\r\n\t<li>Multi Engine Preset Converter utility</li>\r\n\t<li>Bespoke dual-oscillator engine with multiple sound source types: virtual analog, FM, phase distortion, waveshaping, ring modulation, cross modulation, bit reduction, as well as hybrid (80 variations in total).</li>\r\n\t<li>Adjustable note trigger probability.</li>\r\n\t<li>Individual randomization of pitch transposition, sound generator tone, modulation depth/speed, output level.</li>\r\n\t<li>Waveform generators run at 96 kHz sample rate with an anti-aliasing filter for superior quality.</li>\r\n\t<li>Built-in -12 dB/octave multi-mode state variable filter.</li>\r\n\t<li>Flexible modulation generator with 24 modes: exponential envelopes, linear envelopes, multi-waveform LFO (triangle, saw, square, pulse, trapezoid, peak), sample &amp; hold, and random triangle.</li>\r\n\t<li>Built-in lag filters for noise-free, ultra-smooth parameter adjustment and modulation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>System Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Korg Prologue</li>\r\n\t<li>Korg Minilogue XD</li>\r\n\t<li>Korg NTS-1</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Important Note: </strong>This product is a plugin for Korg Prologue, Korg Minilogue XD and Korg NTS-1.

Loom II is ideal for all skill levels. Whether you're starting out and just experimenting in this space or you're a bonafide expert, the instrument grows with you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Loom II is an award-winning modular additive synthesizer with a shape-shifting Morph Pad that makes it easy to create rich, swirling and captivating sounds. The original Loom was considered a triumph of its time when it was launched. Now, Loom II builds on this with unique and powerful new features as requested by our loyal users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Loom II takes a unique modular approach to additive synthesis, a synthesis technique that involves combining simple waveforms together to create complex sounds, by enabling anyone to select from and combine 34 editable modules. Create anything from wobbles, organs, ethereal pads, ambient soundscapes and so much more. The programmable Morph Pad brings your Loom II patches to life by morphing between user-defined variations of your patch, adding motion and momentum that continuously evolve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>New for LOOM II:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Loom II has been expanded to 8 voices by popular request!</li>\r\n\t<li>Spectral Noise section allowing a secondary oscillator to replace or enrich the additive spectrum (created with the Sine Oscillator) with a noise spectrum.

Each of the 34 editable modules performs a specific sonic task—Octaver, Second Tone, Moving Filter, Noise, Linear Lowpass, Modulator, etc. The Loom II framework provides a series of cells, where up to 10 of these modules can interact combine to generate an additive synthesis patch. Each module includes task-specific parameters for detailed, individual control of the patch. For real-time visual feedback of your sound, each module includes a spectrum window, offering a visual indication of how that module is affecting the individual harmonics of the sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Loom II we have added four new powerful modules:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>5-Sines</strong> – An easy-to-use module enabling you to produce a range of organ or sine style sounds.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Discrete Adder</strong> – Similar to Loom 1’s popular adder, but adding a discrete spectrum ideal for creating percussion-based synth instruments.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Hype</strong> – adding Hi and Low Hype with dedicated easy-to-use controls for instant results.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Double Wave</strong> – for our more advanced users: Use dual waves to create complex synth patterns. We have also added a dedicated control for this in the Morph pad.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Make Your Music Move</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Loom II’s Morph Pad is a powerful tool that adds dynamics and movement to your patches. Using a condensed set of control knobs, Loom II enables you to quickly create up to four variations of your sound, and assign each one to different quadrant of the Morph Pad. Point, click, and drag anywhere on the Morph Pad to create a morph path. As the sound moves along this patch, you will hear it morph in real time between your four variations. This morphing can be free-form, or set to sync up to a particular musical unit—1 bar, 4 bars, etc. Plus, each segment of the morph path can be synced individually.   In Loom II, we have expanded our highly-acclaimed morph pad by allowing Points/Paths to be stored and restored separately.  We have also added a new X-Axis mode enabling it to perform like an envelope, which is ideal for rhythmical morph patterns.  For this new mode Snap/Grid is also available.  Additionally, for expanded creativity you can now use parameters not linked to the Morph.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Stunning Sound Design</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Loom II comes packed with sounds. Acclaimed sound designers Richard Devine and Mark Ovenden have created 850+ professional, tweakable patches that include wobbles, pads, bass, soundscapes, and more.  500 all-new presets for LOOM II and 350 re-mastered presets from LOOM I.  You can tweak, analyze, and customize their sounds to make them your own, or dig deep and begin creating your own additive sounds from scratch. For sonic inspiration, Loom II’s Smart Sound Randomizer instantly generates new parameters—or a new mix of modules—to jump-start your sound design sessions. All parameters can be mapped for MIDI control.  Additional preset packs are available free of charge and for purchase from 3rd-party partners to provide additional creativity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More than Modules</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each Loom II patch begins with editable Spectral Distortion and Spectral Modulation controls that influence the overall sound. Three LFOs provide tempo syncable modulation sources that any module can access. Four velocity-sensitive Envelope Generators add an extra layer of control that can change and evolve over time. Octave control, global pitch, glide time, and other patch-specific controls offer additional tools for your custom sound-shaping experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Expressive Effects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On-board effects add extra expression to your customized additive sound creations. Using the drive or distortion on an additive sound can produce an aggressive edge or introduce rich harmonic changes. Modulation effects include a chorus and a phaser. Each adds remarkable depth and motion to your sound. Loom II also includes a reverb effect to help your sound sit in the mix, or to create an expansive audio environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A modular additive synthesizer with a sound-shifting Morph Pad.</li>\r\n\t<li>Loom II has been expanded to 8 voices by popular request!</li>\r\n\t<li>Spectral Noise section allowing a secondary oscillator to replace or enrich the additive spectrum (created with the Sine Oscillator) with a noise spectrum.  This is truly revolutionary in the additive world.  Your creativity is the only limit to what is possible! </li>\r\n\t<li>750+ patches programmed by legendary sound designers</li>\r\n\t<li>Smart Sound Randomizer to quickly design unique sounds.</li>\r\n\t<li>34 editable sound modules; freely combinable in 10 cells.</li>\r\n\t<li>2 additional Subharmonic Optional Partials bellow the normal spectrum. </li>\r\n\t<li>Enhanced Morph Pad options. </li>\r\n\t<li>500 all-new patches covering a wide range of sounds designed by acclaimed sound designers Richard Devine and Mark Ovenden.</li>\r\n\t<li>All original 350 patches re-mastered taking advantage of the new features. </li>\r\n\t<li>New Wave Parameter options.</li>\r\n\t<li>20+ other performance enhancements. </li>\r\n\t<li>Economy mode reduces the load on the host processor with minimal impact on the sound.</li>\r\n\t<li>64-bit plugin: VST, AU, RTAS, and AAX formats.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>System Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PC: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Windows 10, 8 or Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (64-bit Only)</li>\r\n\t<li>Minimum Dual Core 2GHz (Intel Core i5 or i7 Recommended)</li>\r\n\t<li>A <a href=\"http://www.ilok.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">FREE iLok account &amp; Licence Manager</a> is required to authorise this software (a physical USB iLok is not required).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mac: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Mac OS X 10.8.5 - macOS 12 Monterey <strong>(Full Apple silicon (M1) support is not available, but the VST plugin may be compatible with some DAWs if run using Rosetta)</strong>\n</li>\r\n\t<li>Core Duo Processor (Core i5 or i7 Recommended)</li>\r\n\t<li>A <a href=\"http://www.ilok.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">FREE iLok account &amp; Licence Manager</a> is required to authorise this software (a physical USB iLok is not required).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Plugin Formats</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>VST qualified for:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Ableton Live, Cubase, VIP, MPC</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>AU qualified for:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Logic Pro X</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>AAX qualified for:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>ProTools 11+</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>RTAS qualified for:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>ProTools</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Important Notes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A <a href=\"http://www.ilok.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">FREE iLok account &amp; Licence Manager</a> is required to authorise this software (a physical USB iLok is not required).</li>\r\n\t<li>Minimum RAM 4GB (8GB or more recommended)</li>\r\n\t<li>1GB free hard drive space (Download and Installation)</li>\r\n\t<li>Internet Access Required (Download and Authorization)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>"}

Heard on countless prog-rock and new wave tracks in the 70s and 80s, this floor pedal monster comes to the desktop for the very first time. From the dual “constant-beat” oscillators to the girthy ladder filter, DSP wizard Mark Barton (MRB) has modelled every aspect of the original with exceptional accuracy. Get down to the ground with Lowdown! </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Get the Lowdown</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outside of a handful of organ-oriented instruments, the original instrument was the first dedicated foot-controlled bass synthesizer, and with its colossal tone, unquestionably the best sounding. It was used by some of the top acts of 70s and 80s, including Rush, Yes, Genesis, U2, and The Police (check out the intro of \"Don't Stand So Close To Me\" or Phil Collins' \"I Don't Care Anymore.\")</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original design used a Hz/oct oscillator scaling (as opposed to the more conventional volts/oct oscillator scaling), allowing oscillator detuning amount to remain constant across the keyboard by minimizing the phase cancellation that can happen when two oscillators play simultaneously. Along with a couple of other engineering tricks, this contributes to its beefy sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to create Cherry Audio's Lowdown, DSP and synthesis legend Mark Barton carefully analyzed the original's synthesis circuits and precisely recreated them for a massive virtual bass experience like no other. Cherry Audio are simply thrilled with the outcome of this fun and easy-to-use earth-moving bass experience and they hope you love it as much as they do!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Faithful virtual analog emulation of the renowned monophonic bass pedal synth</li>\r\n\t<li>Every aspect precisely modeled in exacting detail with an ultra-realistic interface</li>\r\n\t<li>Beyond bass: propel Lowdown from the fat deep end and up to soaring leads</li>\r\n\t<li>Massive dual oscillators (Saw, Square)</li>\r\n\t<li>Throaty 24dB/octave lowpass filter with controls for Cutoff, Emphasis, and Contour</li>\r\n\t<li>Single-button access to Bull, Tuba, and Bass three factory presets</li>\r\n\t<li>Variable live-panel mode, available with a single click</li>\r\n\t<li>Additional one-button controls to activate Glide, Decay, and Octave</li>\r\n\t<li>Loudness and Filter master \"foot\" sliders</li>\r\n\t<li>Recessed panel provides access to programmable functions: Tune, Beat, Glide, Octave, Mix, and OSC B Frequency</li>\r\n\t<li>Rendered and animated foot pedal keyboard</li>\r\n\t<li>Select from 14 under-the-pedals floor surfaces</li>\r\n\t<li>Over 40 presets in an extensive preset browsing menu, and unlimited user preset storage</li>\r\n\t<li>Full MIDI control</li>\r\n\t<li>Full DAW automation for all controls</li>\r\n\t<li>Lowdown Bass Synthesizer is available in AU, VST, VST3, AAX, and standalone formats</li>\r\n\t<li>A free 30-day demo of Lowdown is available.

An easy-to-tweak instrument that helps you find hit sounds in seconds, unleashing its and your maximum potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lush 2 isn’t based on just a single machine; it’s built from modules that can be found in many modern virtual synths, combined into one compact, logical layout. Don’t let its looks fool you: though it may look benign at first, its modular, multi layer architecture takes it beyond simplistic poly-synths to the top shelf of extremely powerful, deeply programmable and devilishly versatile instruments in your arsenal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suspiciously accurate sound is achieved only through experience: countless hours were spent analyzing classic analogue synthesizers, and then designing and implementing DSP algorithms with close attention to every component in the signal path - not just approximating its overall output. D16 deliver to you a synth built on oscillators of uncompromising quality, filters with an incredibly natural warmth and character, and best-in-class effects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On top of that...with all of the layers, multi-layer options, and routing capabilities the plugin offers - there’s no end to what you can do with just a single instance of Lush 2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Synthesizer</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34987/content_Lush_2_-_Synth_View_-_Main_pib.png\" style=\"width: 550px; height: 336px;\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Lush 2 lets you reach “unheard of” levels of creativity - each layer works as an independent synthesizer with its own polyphony, parameters, enhanced arp, and a choice between 8 of the finest insert effects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Multilayer Architecture</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This guarantees Lush 2 has virtually limitless sound design possibilities and unique applications. You can quickly create multi-layer sounds by simply assigning any (or all) of the 8 layers to the same MIDI channel; this can result in anything from subtle chorusing to sonic anarchy!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Assigning layers to different keyboard zones lets you create sophisticated splits, and an entire split-zone preset library exists to get you started. You can also assign different layers to different MIDI channels for 8-part multi-layer usage, and send out up to 11 audio outputs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Substantial Factory Content</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over 1600 presets (all preset types included) curated into a clear, easy-to-navigate structure. A carefully prepared, categorized and tagged bank always lets you find exactly what you’re looking for - from massive basses, to complex sequences, to the toughest-sounding synthetic percussion you’ve ever heard... you’ll find it all here. Huge, inspiring arpeggiator performances covering an unusually broad scope will draw you in from the first key press. Plus, most of the factory presets make extensive use of the modulation matrix to produce sounds that are much more expressive and flavorful; LuSH-2 was designed to be a musical instrument first and foremost, and therefore the factory presets were designed with playability and personality in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Two Insert Effects per Layer</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From subtle to sabotage: choose from 8 customized effect algorithms per insert, per layer, to hone your sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Inspiring Arpeggiator</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A powerful bespoke arpeggiator section with independent presets to get your groove on!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>VCO With Analog Feel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Innovative oscillator algorithms developed by D16 make Lush 2 sound exactly like a sampled hardware analog synth - but without the sampling! There is no aliasing in the oscillators, even at 22kHz from the note’s base frequency. Vibrato and pitch bend don’t compromise the spectral quality of the oscillators, allowing LuSH-2 to sound completely authentic even with the most challenging performances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Musical Filter</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Resonance is constant across the entire frequency range, making the filter sound totally authentic, especially when controlled with the envelopes or an LFO. Pushing the resonance to maximum and turning all the oscillators down will produce a pure, pleasant sine wave as the filter is driven into self-oscillation, mirroring its hardware counterparts. Of course, keyboard tracking can also be applied to the filter for a smooth, adjustable cutoff gradient across the keyboard range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Modulation Matrix</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34988/content_Lush_2_-_Modulation_Matrix_View_-_Editor_plugin_boutique.jpg\" style=\"width: 550px; height: 336px;\"></strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An entire page dedicated to assigning your modulation to nearly any parameter - pick a source, pick a destination, set an amount: creative modulation!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Arp Tie and Arp Gate as Modulation Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even the arpeggiator’s MIDI output can be used as a modulation source, allowing for complex sequences and refreshingly odd progressions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mixer</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34989/content_Lush_2_-_Mixer_View_plugin_boutique.jpg\" style=\"width: 550px; height: 336px;\"></strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Lush 2 also comes complete with a powerful built-in mixer, complete with layer-independent parametric equalizers and compressors that can be rearranged.

Music Workstation M1</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The M1, released in 1988, is an epoch-making synthesizer that defined the music scene of the late 80’s and the 90s. Its synthesis system with digital multi-effects, based on high-quality PCM, featured a unique sound which was epoch-defining. In addition, as the original music workstation “all-in-one unit”, it came with an 8-track sequencer, drastically changing the composing and production style of musicians everywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The KORG Collection M1 V2 is an upgrade of the M1 software from 2005, and has been refined for modern production environments. KORG added the much requested high-resolution and scalable interface. The preset sounds include all 3,300 programs, including those from the expansion ROM cards, giving the legendary sounds of the M1 through the latest software as a plug-in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A Complete Reproduction of the AI Synthesis System</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The M1 was equipped with the ai (advanced integrated) synthesis system that used PCM waveforms and digital effects processor. While many of the preset sounds were based on PCM sounds, they not only possessed the realness of those sounds but also a unique sounding character, which shows us how advanced the KORG voicing technology has always been.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the KORG Collection M1, the PCM data provides the library of the original M1. For the hardware, KORG analyzed the circuit diagrams of the original design, and completely replicated the circuitry in software down to the last detail. Engineers with an exhaustive knowledge of the M1 made careful adjustments in order to obtain the sound of the original instrument, something that cannot be obtained simply by sampling the original sounds. KORG have also designed the M1 so that programs and combinations are entirely independent – a capability not possible on the original unit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>High-Resolution Interface for Retina and 4K</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major GUI refinements have also been made to the KORG Legacy Collection DIGITAL EDITION M1 software released in 2005. The high-resolution graphics allow it fit into modern Retina &amp; 4K environments. By supporting six levels of scalability, usability has been drastically improved.

Numerous unique M1 sounds were taken up by musicians and producers around the world, and are still in use today. KORG Collection M1 has all of the M1’s preset sounds. In addition to all of the 19 PCM ROM cards originally released for the M1, KORG Collection M1 also covers the sounds of the M1EX that expanded the internal PCM of the M1, as well as the sounds of the KORG T1/T2/T3 synthesizers which KORG released as an evolution of the M1.

{"title": "MASSIVE", "brand": "Native Instruments", "url": "/product/1-Instruments/4-Synth/7998-MASSIVE", "rating": 5.0, "description": "<div itemprop=\"description\"><h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/24989/original_Massive-logo-black.png\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 78px;\"></h4>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Heavyweight Synthesizer</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The synth that defined bass music, this powerhouse synthesizer is an uncompromising sonic monster and the go-to choice for bass music and electro producers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Massive is a sonic monster – the ultimate synth for basses and leads. The virtual-analogue concept belies the contemporary, cutting-edge sound it generates. Clearly laid out and easy to use, Massive gives you earth-shuddering sounds from the very first note.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Massive gives your tracks a solid foundation with the creamiest, punchiest basses. Razor-sharp leads cut through the mix even with grit and dirt piled high. And an overwhelming array of wavetable oscillators, modulation options, and filters, and effects offer a sonic spectrum as broad as it is inspiring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Massive contains over 1300 sounds, all crafted by leading artists and sound designers. The efficient search and intuitive filter functions let you find presets according to specific characteristics and attributes – a particularly musical and intuitive approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Macro Controls</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Massive's macro controls offer fast, direct control - automatically mapped to the eight macro knobs on all Komplete Kontrol S-Series keyboards, and all Maschine hardware.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of a sound's most important parameters are pre-configured and mapped to these controllers. A single controller can handle multiple assignments – for example, just twist 'Rhythm' and watch how multiple underlying parameters change simultaneously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The macro controls enable you to customize any of Massive's presets instantly and profoundly, without having to understand the technical structure of the sound. The macro controls essentially turn each sound into a set of possible sounds that seamlessly morph into one another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, the macro controls are the most important interface to other applications. They are targets for MIDI assignments, which are easily set using the MIDI Learn function. They are also the first eight parameters that are reported to any host when Massive is used as a plug-in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/25048/content_img-ce-massive_featured-details_01_macrocontrols-179cc578ac8753792bb96fd386258abe-d.jpg\" style=\"width: 520px; height: 300px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sound Synthesis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Massive's sound synthesis is based on a unique Wave Scanning algorithm, implemented in three parallel oscillator modules. It combines the highest sonic quality with utmost flexibility and controllability. Think of a Wave Scanning oscillator as a multi-track sequencer; one of the tracks contains a saw wave and the other a pulse wave. In the vertical dimension, each of Massive's oscillators allows these tracks to be faded seamlessly into one another. In the horizontal dimension, a single cycle's read-out speed curve can be manipulated in three different bending modes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Massive features an unlimited number of these \"tracks\" in each wavetable as well as two additional manipulation modes relevant for time and frequency settings. Of course, the “tracks” are not restricted to usual sawtooth or pulse waves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Massive comes with 85 specially designed wavetables, each one with a unique combination of waveforms and particular sonic characteristics. Finally, a modulation oscillator can be used to vary the main oscillators' signal. It can be used for ring modulation, phase modulation (which sounds similar to FM) as well as further modulation modes. A noise generator provides an additional signal source that can be mixed in with the other signals, generating particular effects. It can, for instance, be used in combination with Massive's comb filters for a physical modelling approach to sound design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Flexible Routing</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Massive's basic structure conforms to the well-known subtractive synthesis paradigm, making it easy to understand while simultaneously ensuring the signal flow is highly flexible. You can place two insert effects at various places within the signal flow. You can also take the signal at any point and route it back to the beginning. For example, you can filter a sound and feed it back into the filter's input. This can create very lively and dynamic results. The flexibility is further increased by placing an insert effect into the feedback path.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can route any of the oscillator’s signals directly to the synthesizer's output, bypassing all filters and/or master effects. This feature allows a direct 'punch' to be added to layered, highly modulated sounds, for example, to add a sub-bass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/25050/content_img-ce-massive_featured-details_03_flexiblerouting_2x-2f8a34974441da78a3b9416e19a0c2e4-d.jpg\" style=\"width: 520px; height: 300px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Modulation Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Massive features several types of modulation sources that, thanks to the innovative user interface, can easily be assigned to any of its parameters. Multiple parameters can be assigned to a single macro control, bundling technical settings into a single control – a far more musical approach. For instance, you can assign both the filters' cutoff frequencies to one macro control and label it as \"Brightness\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The envelopes in Massive feature an advanced loop mode: a part of the envelope can be looped and you can morph between different transitions or crossfades for the defined loop start and end points. Various other options make Massive's envelopes truly unique.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Massive contains two step sequencer modes: While the Stepper conforms to the well-known, established operating modes, the Performer allows each step to be shaped individually, making it ideal for advanced rhythmic structures. A flexible low frequency oscillator completes the list of modulation sources. The variety of possibilities is as wide as it is fast to use. This is further enhanced by the inclusion of templates for standard tasks for all the modulation sources, such as envelopes, LFOs, steppers and performers. For example, setting an envelope to a generic ADSR shape is a quick, one-click issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Change The Framework</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Massive's various global settings pages allow a variety of parameters to be adjusted – parameters that most other synthesizers leave unmentioned and unadjustable. Massive unveils their true sound design potential. The Keytracking pages map the incoming pitch information generated by your keyboard or sequencer individually for each oscillator and filter. There is even separate keytracking control over the filters' cut-off frequencies and other additional parameters such as a bandpass filter's width or a comb filter’s feedback. This allows effects to be created that can be controlled by simply playing your keyboard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like in most synthesizers, you can adjust glide times between pitches when you play legato notes. Massive goes a step further, allowing the pitchbend range or the phase of each oscillator to be adjusted. The Voicing page allows switching between polyphonic and monophonic voice handling as well as several voice trigger options, for example playing musical-sounding trills easily with your keyboard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several voices can be triggered by a single note. Much like an orchestra where several violins play the same 'voice', making the sound warmer and more lively, the unisono feature makes your sound thick and vivid. This feature can also be adjusted to extreme settings, spreading your voices over several octaves or filling the stereo panorama – all with just one single note being played.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/25051/content_img-ce-massive_featured-details_05_changetheframework_2x-98a4220880831d3b4a4ebcc307aaaeb7-d.jpg\" style=\"width: 520px; height: 300px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Library</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Massive contains over 1300 production-ready sounds, including the full libraries from former products 'Massive Expansion' 1 and 2, 'Urban Arsenal' 1 and 2, and 'Massive Threat'.

Whether you are focused on audio quality, maximum creativity or ease-of-use, MPowerSynth provides more. MPowerSynth is a new class of synthesizers focused on the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Most Advanced User Interface on the Market - Stylable, Resizable, GPU Accelerated</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Modern user interfaces must not only be easy and quick to use, but also versatile and the whole visual appearance should inspire you. MPowerSynth features the most advanced GUI engine on the market. It is still the first and only GUI engine, which is freely resizable and stylable. It also lets you choose between knobs, sliders or buttons, whichever you like the most.</li>\r\n\t<li>The plugin can look as an ancient vintage gear, if you are working on old-school rock music. Or as super-modern futuristic device if you are working on modern electronic music.</li>\r\n\t<li>If your display doesn't have a high resolution, you can make the plugin smaller. If the fonts are too small, you can make the plugin bigger and save your eyes.</li>\r\n\t<li>All the graphics is accelerated using your GPU, graphical interface, providing ultimately quick response and keep your CPU focused on the audio.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Unique Visualisation Engine with Classic Meters and Time Graphs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Your ears should always be the main judge, but a smart metering system can often be a huge help. MPowerSynth provides the most advanced metering system out there. The plugin can display the measurements of all relevant values using classic meters, or it can even show them in time using the time graphs. Everything is customisable as usual.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Modulators</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>MPowerSynth provides 8 fully-featured modulators which can control any set of parameters including other modulators. Each modulator works as an LFO, level follower, midi/audio triggered ADSR enveloper, randomiser or pitch detector, or even a combination and can listen to the plugin\\'s side-chain.</li>\r\n\t<li>You can make the sound move in time, be less static and more interesting. You can make various parameters depend on the input (or the sidechain) level or even listen to the input pitch.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Adjustable Oscillator Shape Technology</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Every oscillator in MPowerSynth uses the most versatile oscillator algorithm on the market. It provides mix of predefined oscillator shapes, custom waveforms edited using our MeldaProduction Envelope System (MES), a step-sequencer and several methods for algorithmic post-processing.</li>\r\n\t<li>It also provides a harmonic mode, which lets you control the harmonic content instead of oscillator shape. This is especially useful for high frequency oscillators.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Multiparameters</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>MPowerSynth lets you control multiple parameters using a single so-called multiparameter. This may not only come handy for automation for example, but the multiparameters are very smart units and you can use them to smartly morph between banks of settings for example. All in the name of creativity!System Requirements</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Smart Randomisation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Being creative is sometimes complicated and one often needs an inspiration. By clicking a single button you can walk through the billions of possible settings and find the best one for you. The smart randomisation algorithm wisely selects good sounding combinations of parameters. It can even randomise modulators for you. And if that\\'s too much, you can just hold ctrl and MPowerSynth will just slightly modify existing settings.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Automatic Gain Compensation (AGC)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Most plugins change loudness of the output audio, which makes browsing presets inconvenient, not mentioning randomisation. MPowerSynth includes automatic gain compensation, which quickly adapts to current settings and ensures the output sounds as loud as the input. This even protects you from thinking that something sounds better in cases it is just louder.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Safety Limiter</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Some plugins can intensely increase gain when exposed to specific audio materials. MPowerSynth provides a safety brick wall limiter, which ensures the output stays below 0dB and prevents your equipment and your ears from potential danger automatically.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sync Interpolation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>MPowerSynth implements the most advanced interpolation technology to provide the best audio quality.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Adjustable Up-Sampling 1x-16x</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Digital audio provides very superior audio quality compared to ancient analog gear, but there are problems too. The main problem is the aliasing, which may be noticeable when using nonlinear processes such as compression or saturation. MPowerSynth includes both minimum-phase and high-quality linear-phase upsampling algorithms, which avoids the aliasing.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Synchronisation to Host Tempo</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Every oscillator and modulator in the plugin can automatically synchronise to the host. But it can be out-of-sync if you want of course.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MIDI Controllers with MIDI Learn</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>MPowerSynth contains a powerful MIDI processor, which listen to MIDI controllers and MIDI keyboard and control any parameters realtime.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>64-bit Processing and an Unlimited Sampling Rate</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>MPowerSynth provides the maximum audio quality you can get. It uses 64-bit audio processing and can handle any sampling rate. It does not make much sense to go over 192kHz, but if you think it is a good idea, the plugin can do that.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Extremely Fast, Optimised for Newest AVX Capable Processors</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Computers are now extremely fast, but the algorithms are more complex and projects bigger, so we still need to use the processing power with care. MPowerSynth uses the fastest algorithms, takes advantage of the newest processor capabilities, lets your GPU handle the graphics, and shares the resources with other MeldaProduction plugins. The plugin is among the fastest on the market, yet it provides the best possible audio quality.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Global Preset Management and Online Preset Exchange</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>MPowerSynth presets are carefully stored in a system database and you can quickly access them from any project in any host. The plugin can automatically share your presets and download presets of other users from our servers. We are building a community and you can be a part of it!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Supports VST, VST3, AU and AAX Interfaces on Windows &amp; Mac</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>MPowerSynth supports all major hosts on both platforms. Check system requirements for information about compatibility and installation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>No Dongle nor Internet Access is Required for Activation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>How many times did you forget your USB dongle? We are an honest company and expect the same from our customers. Our software uses licence files to activate your software. And the licences are to-person, so you can use it on all your computers as long as you are the user.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Free-for-Life Updates</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>When you buy the software you are entitled to free updates, forever. No more money wasted on major upgrades like it is with other companies.

Semi-Modular Synthesizer MS-20</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Released in 1978, the analog synthesizer MS-20 is undoubtedly one of the most famous and respected synthesizers of all time. This massive bestseller by KORG, with its fat and sticky sound, powerful self-oscillating filter, and freely adjustable patch section, is still popular with professionals and amateurs today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the MS-20 V2 in this KORG Collection has been based on the software-emulated MS-20 from 2004, it has been refined for modern production environments. In addition to the often-requested high-resolution and scalable interface, KORG have added two new multi-effects. All of the analog sounds and behaviors are realistically reproduced by CMT, KORG’s proprietary electronic Circuit Modeling Technology, and this latest software gives you the powerful sound that only the MS-20 can deliver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A Complete Reproduction of Its Punchy and Unique Sound</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The MS-20 is widely known for its extreme sound range. It has two VCO’s with ring modulators, an EG with hold and delay functions, and for maximizing resonance as an oscillator, an intense self-oscillating high-pass / low pass filter. This semi-modular synthesizer has an external signal processor that allows external audio input as well as a very flexible patch system, making it possible to create extremely complex sounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The MS-20 of the KORG Collection faithfully reproduces the sound of the original MS-20 and behavior of its many parameters with KORG’s proprietary electronic circuit modeling technology CMT (Component Modeling Technology). Instead of merely simulating the output sound as conventional modeling does, KORG’s CMT is a method for using digital equivalents of the transistors, capacitors, resistors, and other components used in the hardware realm to reconstruct the same signal path digitally. This perfectly reproduces the complex range of sounds and parameters that can only be created with the MS-20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>High-Resolution Interface for Retina and 4K</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>KORG have made major GUI refinements to the KORG Legacy Collection MS-20 software originally released in 2004. Its high-resolution graphics that will make it fit into modern Retina &amp; 4K environments. By supporting six levels of scalability, usability has been drastically improved. Enjoy features that are easy to use and give so many sonic options which are unique to the MS-20 while controlling many parameters such as patching, at high resolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"411\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35759/original_569b24cad37efb284f1c15c060259b11_pc.jpg\" width=\"600\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Two Newly Added Multi-Effects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>32 voices of polyphony and up to 16-voice unison (with detune/spread function) were added to the original software. Flexible external modulation settings and MIDI clock synchronization have also been introduced, allowing for sound production with a high level of flexibility and freedom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, the KORG Collection MS-20 V2 has two new multi-effects. With a total of 21 effects such as compression, EQ, delay, reverb, and 127 kinds of ready-to-use effect programs, the variety in sound makeup has significantly expanded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"410\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35760/original_e5259c82dd32f6bd9e5a9de75502e82e_pc.jpg\" width=\"600\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>200 Latest Presets</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>200 new presets have been added to the original presets of the previous KORG Legacy Collection MS-20. There are many new presets that showcase the potential of the MS-20 such as sticky bass sounds - unique to the MS-20 - sounds with unrestricted patching, along with powerful leads that make use of the polyphonic and unison functionality unique to the software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to being able to register sounds that you like as favorites so you recall them immediately, there is a new convenient program browser that allows you to narrow sounds down by type, allowing you to quickly find the sound that you are looking for.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Faithful modelling of the MS-20 circuitry using KORG’s Component Modeling Technology (CMT).</li>\r\n\t<li>High-resolution interface for Retina and 4K.</li>\r\n\t<li>Two newly added multi-effects.</li>\r\n\t<li>250 updated and new presets</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>System Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mac</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Mac OS X 10.14 Mojave or higher (latest update)</li>\r\n\t<li>Intel Core i5 or better (Core i7 or better recommended) (<strong>Apple Silicon Native supported)</strong>\n</li>\r\n\t<li>8 GB RAM (16 GB or more recommended)</li>\r\n\t<li>8 GB free disk space (SSD recommended)</li>\r\n\t<li>AU, VST, VST3, AAX (Supported 64bit plug-ins only)</li>\r\n\t<li>An internet connection is required</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PC</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Windows 10 64bit or higher (latest update)</li>\r\n\t<li>Intel Core i5 or better (Core i7 or better recommended)</li>\r\n\t<li>8 GB RAM (16 GB or more recommended)</li>\r\n\t<li>8 GB free disk space (SSD recommended)</li>\r\n\t<li>VST, VST3, AAX (Supported 64bit plug-ins only)</li>\r\n\t<li>An internet connection is required</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>"}

And it was equally critical to capture every nuance of its 15 filter modes, so we kept at it until they had been modeled perfectly!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another factor in defining the complex sound of the Matrix-12 was the amazing number of modulation sources and destinations it provided. This was a level of sophistication previously only available in a fully modular system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So to complete the emulation we modeled these capabilities also, even surpassing them.

Released in 1982, the Memorymoog raised the sonic bar with its lush, powerful analog sound. It expands upon the original without compromising any of the sound or functionality that made it great and does away with the reliability, maintenance, and tuning issues of the original. The user interface has been streamlined and simplified, updating the original instrument’s numeric-keypad-and-command-numbers with fast, simple-to-use pop-up menus and an improved value display window.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMemorymode delivers a one-two punch of huge tonality, with super-accurate replications of the original three-oscillator voice architecture and precise implementation of the coveted ladder filter circuit. Further contributing to its famous hefty sound, the oscillator mixer gently overdrives when levels are cranked, just like the original.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIn addition to all of the voicing and modulation that made the original sound so great, Cherry Audio has added a number of creative and convenient features aimed at modern music makers. Memorymode’s LFO, arpeggio, and delay effects all feature one-button tempo sync, and filter and amplitude velocity sensitivity add a whole new layer of expressiveness. A unique Drift parameter allows continuously variable adjustment of tuning accuracy, from perfectly in tune, to aged and loose, or anywhere in between, and the Modern button brings Memorymode into the present with fattened bass and sparkling highs.

{"title": "Mercury-4", "brand": "Cherry Audio", "url": "/product/1-Instruments/4-Synth/8062-Mercury-4", "rating": 5.0, "description": "<div itemprop=\"description\"><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"98\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/25395/original_mercury_logo.png\" width=\"402\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Poly In The Beginning</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Originally released in 1978, the Roland Jupiter-4 synthesizer was one of the earliest instruments to combine voice-assign polyphony with digital patch storage - that is, the ability to store and recall sounds to digital memory and recall them at the touch of a button. \"Voice-assign polyphony,” refers to instruments with a finite number of independent synthesizer voices (four, in this case) that digitally scan the keyboard and assign notes to onboard voices. These days, voice-assign polyphony and digital patch storage are taken for granted, but this was a HUGE deal in the late 70s when options for polyphonic synthesis were mostly limited to crude string synthesizers based upon 60s organ technology, and patch recall was generally limited to how fast you could twirl knobs and flick switches!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIn its day, the Jupiter-4 was overshadowed by larger, more complex (and far more expensive) instruments from American synth manufacturers, and on paper, its specs weren’t as impressive. But specs don't tell the whole story, because the Jupiter-4 sounds fantastic, with a raw, raunchy tone not found in any of the other beloved Juno and Jupiter synths. Its analogue oscillators have a uniquely aggressive tone quality, the built-in sub-oscillator adds girth, its oddly fast and deep LFO modulation capabilities allow it to create uniquely whacked out modular synth-like tones, and Roland's famous stereo chorus \"ensemble\" circuit is beautifully implemented, adding a boatload of width and dimension.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe original instrument had its share of caveats, including a meagre eight user patch locations, no edit mode for stored patches, just four voices of polyphony, it weighed a ton (a portly 42 lb!), and the lack of oscillator autotune meant a cold breeze could send it careening out of tune. Cherry Audio's Mercury-4 addresses every one of these issues, with up to 16-voice polyphony, infinite patch storage, easy patch editing, and much more.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIn addition to recreating the Jupiter-4's uniquely powerful oscillator and filter tonality, Mercury-4 beautifully replicates Roland’s renowned stereo ensemble effect. They've also added a truly other-worldly \"Space Echo\"-style tape echo with multiple reverb modes. The tape echo perfectly recreates the warm tonality and subtle speed variations that make the original Space Echo units so desirable, and the reverb section expands upon the original spring reverb with plate and hall modes for enhanced spatial depth.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Authentically modelled oscillator with sub-oscillator</li>\r\n\t<li>All filter characteristics modelled, including powerful low-frequency resonance</li>\r\n\t<li>Up to 16-voice polyphony</li>\r\n\t<li>Over 300 presets, programmed by industry veterans</li>\r\n\t<li>Exactingly replicated unique arpeggio section w/tempo sync</li>\r\n\t<li>Carefully modelled wide-range LFO modulation with \"inverted\" mod characteristics</li>\r\n\t<li>Drift control for increased analogue realism</li>\r\n\t<li>Precisely replicated stereo ensemble effect</li>\r\n\t<li>Warm and organic tape echo with multiple reverb modes</li>\r\n\t<li>Tempo-syncable LFO</li>\r\n\t<li>Detunable unison mode</li>\r\n\t<li>Single-key chord memory mode</li>\r\n\t<li>Highly optimized coding for high performance with ultra-low CPU load</li>\r\n\t<li>Advanced one-click UI magnification</li>\r\n\t<li>Comprehensive MPE support</li>\r\n\t<li>Full MIDI control and DAW automation for all controls</li>\r\n\t<li>Mercury-4 is available in AU, VST, VST3, AAX, and standalone formats</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>System Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mac</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>10.13 or above.</li>\r\n\t<li>macOS 13 Ventura supported.</li>\r\n\t<li>64-bit required.</li>\r\n\t<li>Native Apple M1 processor support, including Apple M1 Ultra.</li>\r\n\t<li>3.4 GHz Quad-Core or M1 CPU with 8GB of RAM recommended.</li>\r\n\t<li>Available in AU, VST, VST3, AAX &amp; Standalone formats</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Windows</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Windows 7 or above (including Windows 11), 64-bit required.</li>\r\n\t<li>Quad-core computer with 8GB of RAM recommended.</li>\r\n\t<li>Available in VST, VST3, AAX &amp; Standalone formats</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>"}

Sandwiched between the earlier Jupiter-4 and Jupiter-8 models in name only, the sophisticated Jupiter-6 has sometimes been considered a sleeper release. These days, it has persevered to become one of Roland's most notable and coveted classic synthesizers due to its distinctive dark and complex character. If you've long yearned to explore the Jupiter-6, you'll love Mercury-6!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/33971/content_Mercury-6-img-nav.jpg\" style=\"width: 560px; height: 420px;\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Year Everything Changed</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Released in 1983 as a more affordable alternative to the flagship eight-voice Jupiter-8, the six-voice Jupiter-6 nevertheless staked out an essential position in the history of analog polysynths. Though similar in appearance and feature set, the Jupiter-6 sounded considerably different from the Jupiter-8. The Jupiter-6's versatile filter design lent a more aggressive sound than previous Jupiters, making it a natural for cutting-edge techno and electro styles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Jupiter-6 VCOs supported multiple simultaneous waveforms, and its two LFOs and oscillator cross mod capabilities provided extensive modulation possibilities. Its earthshaking solo and poly unison modes enabled massive lead and bass sounds, and it was one of the first synthesizers to include the then-new MIDI protocol. However, the cost-cutting in the Jupiter-6 design resulted in some disadvantages. Audio output was mono only, and it was limited to six-voice polyphony, hampering the potential of its split keyboard feature. And its timing was ill-fated with the release of Yamaha's revolutionary DX7 the same year. But in a testament to the Jupiter-6's staying power over the decades, its popularity grew in genres such as big beat, house, and techno. As a result, the original hardware is still in demand today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mercury-6: Twice As Nice at a Fraction of the Price</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cherry Audio's Mercury-6 captures all that is exceptional in this classic and boosts the extraordinary feature set and functionality for today's DAW production and workflow. The Cherry Audio team have added velocity sensitivity, improved the split mode, and added a layer mode capable of stacking two different sounds simultaneously with per-layer stereo panning, detuning, and sustain. A panel control lets users easily select and navigate between these layers and includes a utility function for exchanging settings between the lower and upper layers, or even between presets. And with polyphony extended to 16 notes, Mercury-6 won't easily run out of voices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They have also reproduced the arpeggiator, including the hidden Up/Down modes of the original, and augmented it by adding a Random mode and MIDI tempo sync. A chord memory mode enables multiple notes to be stored and played back with a single key. Cherry Audio have improved the functionality of the LFOs with a retrigger for LFO-1 and an always-on option for LFO-2, both syncable to MIDI tempo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cherry Audio also introduced an integrated studio-quality effects panel with brilliant-sounding distortion, phaser, flanger/chorus, delay, and reverb. With additional touches such as per-layer drift control, over 500 expertly designed presets, and flexible MIDI mapping, Cherry Audio's Mercury-6 brings the authentic Jupiter-6 experience 40 years into the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Highly optimized, massive dual-layer voicing architecture with 16 polyphonic voices per layer.

Though its innards aren’t identical, it shares the thick, juicy, \"fat\" analog sound that remains unchallenged 50 years later! It set the standard for future synthesizers, inspired whole new genres of music, and defined the sound of artists as diverse as Kraftwerk, Herbie Hancock, Rick Wakeman, Pink Floyd, Parliament, and Gary Numan, and countless others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>And now, with Cherry Audio Miniverse, it's your turn!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Miniverse was conceived as the ultimate tribute to an original instrument. Cherry Audio focused on a single principle: absolute authenticity. In association with DSP master and frequent collaborator Mark Barton (MRB), Cherry Audio studied and measured every nuance, every curve, and every response of the audio. Even the Miniverse interface is a meticulous recreation, from the maple cabinet and textured surface to the unmistakable knobs and switches. Cherry Audio avoided the temptation to add extra features, such as additional LFOs or effects, which might distract from the spirit and vibe. Instead, Miniverse portrays the pure, raw, powerful sound and feel of the classic original.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>All About the Sound</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you're seeking monstrous leads, funky basslines, or warm atmospheric pads, Miniverse has you covered. In fact, the resulting tones are so mighty that Cherry Audio could not resist adding one particular enhancement. If one classic synth voice isn't enough, Cherry Audio made it easy to dial in two, four, eight, or sixteen polyphonic voices guaranteed to bring the house down. Need outstanding sounds even faster? Miniverse includes a library of over 250 presets created by pro professional sound designers. Brass, keys, percussion, sound effects, and even MIDI Polyphonic Expression (MPE) presets and, of course, signature earthshaking basses and leads are just a click away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Preset MIDI Mapping</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of presets, by popular demand, Cherry Audio added an important feature to Miniverse: the ability to save custom MIDI controller mappings to individual presets or globally (or both!).</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Three oscillators with triangle, sawtooth-triangular, ramp sawtooth, square, wide rectangular, and narrow rectangular waveforms</li>\r\n\t<li>Classic four-pole, 24dB/octave ladder filter</li>\r\n\t<li>Feedback and Sidechain, replicating the original instrument's External Input function with super accurately replicated overdrive characteristics</li>\r\n\t<li>Fully programmable with over 200 factory preset patches created by pro sound designers </li>\r\n\t<li>Monophonic and polyphonic modes: 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 voices</li>\r\n\t<li>Superbly accurate modelling of inherent oscillator mixer and VCA overdrive characteristics</li>\r\n\t<li>MIDI Polyphonic Expression (MPE) support for expressive performances using MPE-compatible controllers</li>\r\n\t<li>Complete MIDI control and DAW automation for all controls, with easy-to-use MIDI learn</li>\r\n\t<li>Preset and Global level MIDI mapping</li>\r\n\t<li>Cherry Audio's acclaimed Focus zoom-in feature</li>\r\n\t<li>Highly optimized coding for optimal performance with ultra-low CPU load</li>\r\n\t<li>User-adjustable oversampling control</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>If You Can Afford a Toy Truck...</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compared to a vintage original or a recent reissue synthesizer, Cherry Audio is again bringing an absolute classic synthesizer to the desktop in the form of Miniverse for the inconceivably low price of only $39 (List $59).</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>System Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mac</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>10.13 or above.</li>\r\n\t<li>macOS 13 Ventura supported.</li>\r\n\t<li>64-bit required.</li>\r\n\t<li>Native Apple M1 processor support, including Apple M1 Ultra.</li>\r\n\t<li>3.4 GHz Quad-Core or M1 CPU with 8GB of RAM recommended.</li>\r\n\t<li>Available in AU, VST, VST3, AAX &amp; Standalone formats</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Windows</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Windows 7 or above (including Windows 11), 64-bit required.</li>\r\n\t<li>Quad-core computer with 8GB of RAM recommended.</li>\r\n\t<li>Available in VST, VST3, AAX &amp; Standalone formats</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Important Notes: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>MPE requires a DAW and hardware controller supporting MIDI Polyphonic Expression.</li>\r\n\t<li>A free 30-day demo of Miniverse is available.

The sounds it produces can be warm, lush, and luxurious or fat, distorted, and gnarly but not at all ear-piercing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21043/content_1.jpeg\" style=\"height:375px; width:500px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Modelled from a Pristine Hardware Unit From 1972</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The software components of Model 72 were measured and matched down to the smallest details from the original hardware, keeping all of its quirks and non-linearities intact. For example, one trick that's commonly used on the hardware version is connecting a cable from the high-gain output to the external input of the unit to create a roaring, raw, and exciting feedback tone heard on countless records. Obviously, Softube had to add this feature to the Model 72 Instrument plug-in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21044/content_2.jpeg\" style=\"height:375px; width:500px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A Classic Synth with Modern Features</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Softube updated this legendary synth with some new features, too. An expansion panel lets you tweak some of the finer details of the oscillator behavior as well as some performance aspects of the synth. The doubling feature adds the effect of having the notes that are played doubled by another Model 72, and the spread feature sets how much this doubling will spread out in the stereo field. These improvements allow you to do even more than you could with the original hardware.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21045/content_3.jpeg\" style=\"height:375px; width:500px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The User Interface</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tone Generation &amp; Mixer</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tone generator is the heart of Model 72. This section consists of 3 oscillators, with the top two identical in terms of output waveforms and features and linked to the incoming note information. The third oscillator can be unlinked from the incoming note information and used as a free-running modulation oscillator with extended tuning range on the tune knob, and also features slightly different waveforms. The mixer section consists of 5 switches for turning on and off the different sound sources that mix into the filter and amp sections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Envelopes &amp; Filter</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The combined signals from the mixer enter a voltage-controlled 4 pole low-pass filter with resonance control (feedback). The filter cutoff frequency can be controlled via the cutoff knob, but is also dynamically modified in real time by the dedicated envelope generators in this section and also the separate modulation section. The top envelope generator, with attack, decay, and sustain knobs, shapes the harmonic content of the sound and bottom the bottom one shapes the amplitude. Both envelope generators are started when you play a note and will go through their individual phases in the time set by the knobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Modulation Section</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The modulation section includes the master tune knob that sets the overall fine tuning of the Model 72, the note glide rate, and the modulation mix. You have the classic options of using either the oscillator 3 output or the noise, and Softube have also added a dedicated Low Frequency Oscillator (LFO) that can be used as an optional modulation source. All modulation is routed through the modulation wheel that works as an attenuator to determine the amount of modulation distributed to the destination. Modulation in can be routed to oscillator pitch, filter cutoff frequency, or both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Output Section</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The output section includes the master volume knob that controls overall output volume. Just below master volume knob is the A440 button, which is the tuning guide tone on and off. It turns on a 440 Hz (A4) sine oscillator for quick tuning. Below the A440 button, you find the doubling feature and the spread knob. Enabling doubling adds the effect of having the notes played doubled by another Model 72, and the spread knob sets the how much this doubling will spread out in the stereo field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21046/content_1200px-product-model-72.png\" style=\"height:397px; width:800px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Model 72 Instrument</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use the instrument plug-in on instrument channels controlled via MIDI to create the original sounds this synth is known for. This includes the feedback loop trick, the famous trick of running a cable from the high output to the external input for more overdriven, distorted, and cool sounds. You can use a connected MIDI keyboard controller, or you can edit notes in your DAW to play it. Model 72 will respond to the full range of your keyboard and can also be configured to respond to velocity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Model 72 FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using the synth as an effect by running an external sound source to the external audio input is a common use case heard on countless albums from the 1970s to today. Add the FX plug-in to your audio or mix track to replicate this external input feature and use the distortions and filter on your sound source. Route a MIDI channel to your effect and play a note in order to gate the sound processed through the effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21054/content_2b.jpeg\" style=\"height:488px; text-align:center; width:650px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Amp Room Ready</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Model 72 Amp Room module consists of the fat sounding filter from this legendary synthesizer complete with envelope follower, cutoff, resonance, and drive. There are two different envelope follower modes, fast and smooth. There's also a mix knob for blending the effect to fine-tune the sound. Create truly unique sounds for guitar, bass, and keyboards with a vintage vibe with this incredible envelope filter effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21055/content_3b.jpeg\" style=\"height:488px; text-align:center; width:650px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Modular Ready</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the Model 72 Instrument sections are available as individual modules for Softube Modular, ready to be added to your Eurorack system. It’s easy to combine single parts of the synthesizer in a modular workflow to build patches and get authentic vintage monophonic sounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21056/content_4b.jpeg\" style=\"height:488px; width:650px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Modular Modules</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tone Generator</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Includes all seven waveforms used in the plug-in. Use a mixer or gain module to get these oscillators to perform well with the other modules in Modular with correct gain-staging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21047/content_1a.jpeg\" style=\"height:300px; width:400px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Amplifier</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amplifies and also distorts audio. The top CV jack is pre-patched to 7.5V and this voltage is scaled through the amp CV attenuator potentiometer. Additional CV need to be inserted for the amp to amplify/pass audio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21048/content_2a.jpeg\" style=\"height:300px; width:400px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Filter</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This classic fat lowpass filter self-oscillates when it goes past 8 and can track 1 V/octave fairly well when the 33% and 66% switches are both engaged. The level knob is dampening for the input.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21049/content_3a.jpeg\" style=\"height:300px; width:400px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Envelope</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A gate above 0.66V in the gate jack activates the envelope. The decay knob also sets the release time when release switch is set to on. Release time is set to zero when the release switch is turned off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21050/content_4a.jpeg\" style=\"height:300px; width:400px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Noise and Glide</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A white/pink noise generator and a glide buffer. The white/pink noise output is based on performance of the original circuitry. The glide buffer is mainly designed for slewing control voltages but can be used to slew anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21051/content_5a.jpeg\" style=\"height:300px; width:400px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Doubling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Essentially the same effect as the Model 72 plug-in, but here it can be set gradually with the doubling knob and then the spread knob will expand the effect in stereo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21052/content_6a.jpeg\" style=\"height:300px; width:400px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Preamp</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The preamp for external audio gives a very nice distortion when pushed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21053/content_7a.jpeg\" style=\"height:300px; width:400px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>An entire system based on a classic analogue monophonic synth from the early 1970s with the emphasis on sound quality.</li>\r\n\t<li>Era correct: component-modelled to perfection, with all the quirks and non-linearities intact – it sounds and behaves just like its original hardware counterpart.</li>\r\n\t<li>Actual use cases and tricks of the hardware correctly replicated in the software.</li>\r\n\t<li>Four versions included: Model 72 Instrument, Model 72 FX, Model 72 module for Softube Amp Room, and seven Model 72 modules for Softube Modular.

{"title": "Model 84 Polyphonic Synthesizer", "brand": "Softube", "url": "/product/1-Instruments/4-Synth/7550-Model-84-Polyphonic-Synthesizer", "rating": 5.0, "description": "<div itemprop=\"description\"><h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Resurrection of a Polyphonic Icon</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>An 80s-era icon of polyphonic synthesizing faithfully emulated through circuit modelling on a component level.</li>\r\n\t<li>The true-to-the-original sound and unique features of the revered hardware—such as two poly modes with proper voice allocation—plus fresh innovations.</li>\r\n\t<li>Three versions included: instrument, a chorus for Amp Room, and seven modules for Modular.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The year is 1984. Splashing down is a majorly righteous polyphonic synthesizer that will go on to outrun its era. Thirty-odd years later, Softube are still vibing on the gnarly Synthwave reverberations this paragon can produce. Used on countless records by innumerable artists, it’s a six-voice synth that set a standard and established a sound. Now it’s time to discover what it can do in the DAW.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Softube applied their award-winning modelling expertise to a fully-serviced and calibrated 1984 unit and the result is a perfect facsimile of the original hardware. Using rock &amp; roll science, Softube have created a plugin that has all the quirks and non-linearities of the 1980s-era idol. Even the clutch factory presets with easy recall of the '80s sounds heard on copious number-one hits. Added features and flexibility bring the prototype’s influential and unmistakable sound motoring into modern production environs: from Softube's official Eurorack platform, Modular, to Softube's pro audio guitar &amp; bass platform, Amp Room—and beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Introducing the most excellent Model 84 Polyphonic Synthesizer. The retro-future is here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Designed by Experts, Built on Legacy</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Softube has a decades-long history of modelling premium audio gear in concert with professional audio brands like Tube-Tech, Solid State Logic, Chandler Limited®, Weiss Engineering, and Trident. Softube's track record of flawlessly recreating hardware classics in software form is well-established. It's an expertise that extends to synthesizer plugins like Modular and Model 72.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Model 84 is built on this legacy. Softube used the same exacting standards and skills—precise testing and experienced fine-tuning—and the outcome is sound quality that equals the hardware. Or, in terms of clarity, surpasses it. Always more, nothing less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Model: An Authentic Emulation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Softube poured the same fastidious modelling energy into Model 84 Polyphonic Synthesizer that goes into every piece of their gear. The result is voice allocation modes and an EQ—with bass boost for extra oomph on basslines—that mirror the iconic hardware.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Softube's meticulous recreation of the unison phase allows you to assign all six voices to one note and to achieve the sounds of the synth that became an industry touchstone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Control: Added Features</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Model 84 is about control. Extended unison mode gives authority over sync and enables a more pronounced attack to the start of a note. Velocity and aftertouch support promote enhanced dynamic performance with command over the amp, as well as the filter and PW. And the expanded control panel, with added velocity and aftertouch parameters, makes it easier to fine-tune sound and behaviour. Get ‘80s mojo in the digital domain—your way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Presets: Original &amp; Contemporary</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Get the authentic sound of the Decade of Greed without spending a  second fussing with knobs. Model 84 comes packed with both the original presets as well as striking new artist presets. Quickly recall classic sounds, original patches, distorted bass sounds, and the Synthwave heard on so many classic and contemporary albums. Or set it to stun with incredible artist presets that range from retro sounds to modern-day fat- and wide-sounding crispy leads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sweet Synthesis: The Modular Modules</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The synth sound made classic in the 1980s is now available in Modular. Seven fully integrated modules allow you to easily combine pieces of the Model 84 Polyphonic Synthesizer in a modular workflow. Artistically patch Model 84 modules with other Modular-ready gear like the monophonic legend, Model 72—a feat previously impossible in both digital and analogue realms. Model 84 delivers universe-expanding capabilities and mind-blowing creative possibilities to the Modular ecosystem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Electric Friends: The Amp Room Module</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Model 84's Chorus is a totally unique and brand-new module for Amp Room. Previously unavailable on the pro audio guitar and bass platform, you can now create bodacious guitar or bass sounds with the chorus used in the original keyboard synthesizer and as a design inspiration on a famous guitar stompbox from the Decade of Decadence and big hair. Powerfully dirty and fat, Chorus produces a distinct sound that adds mega wattage to your creativity.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">User Interface</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Low-Frequency Oscillator</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The LFO section is used for modulation in Model 84. It can be applied to pitch (vibrato), PWM (pulse width modulation of the square wave), or to modulate filter cut-off frequency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/23089/content_model-84-user-interface-LFO-2.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 261px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Digitally-Controlled Analog Oscillators</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The heart of the Model 84 Polyphonic Synthesizer is the DCO section. It sets up the type of harmonic or nonharmonic content that is shaped by the LPF, VCA, EQ, and Chorus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/23090/content_model-84-user-interface-DCO.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 261px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Low Pass Filter</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The LPF section contains a filter that shapes the sound of the oscillators’ overtones. It will make the sound duller when you lower the cutoff frequency, and brighter when you raise the cut-off frequency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/23091/content_model-84-user-interface-LPF.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 261px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pitch &amp; Modulation Wheels</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The parameters of the PITCH and MOD performance modulation section determine how much the pitch-bend and modulation wheel on your keyboard will affect the pitch, filter, and vibrato.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/23092/content_model-84-user-interface-pitch-and-mod.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 246px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Glide Time &amp; Voice Allocation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the GLIDE section, you can set the glide time between each note. The VOICING section is where you choose the voice allocation mode of either Poly 1, Poly 2, or Unison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/23093/content_model-84-user-interface-glide-voice.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 251px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Envelope Generator</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Envelope Generator is used to describe time-based changes in a sound. Using the Attack (A), Decay (D), Sustain (S), and Release (R) sliders, the Model 84 Envelope Generators can be used to shape either the harmonic content of the sound or the amplitude of the played sound. Or both at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/23094/content_model-84-user-interface-ENV.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 251px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Voltage-Controlled Amplifier</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The VCA section of Model 84 determines the behaviour (gated or enveloped) and bias of the voltage-controlled amplifier going into the EQ and Chorus sections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/23095/content_model-84-user-interface-VCA.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 251px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Equalization &amp; Chorus</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EQ and Chorus sections are home to a simple four-preset EQ and a stereo chorus that are the icing on the cake of the legendary Model 84 Polyphonic Synthesizer sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/23096/content_model-84-user-interface-EQ-chorus.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 251px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tricks and Treats</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Model 84 is a highly accurate emulation of the storied polyphonic synthesizer that became a music industry staple. Every trait, trick, and mannerism of the original hardware is now available to you in software form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You get the unadulterated sound and behaviour of the original with dead perfect execution every time. The mod-wheel and pitch-wheel assignments affect your pitch, filter, and vibrato in the software the same as they would in the original 1980s gear. The perfectly recreated LPF tracking allows you to play the filter when self-oscillating, just like in the 1984 model unit. And the glide function gives you proper voice allocation—even when the sustain pedal is held down—encouraging wonderfully creative playing techniques in the two poly modes. Just like the original. With the true-blue authentic Model 84 Polyphonic Synthesizer plug-in, you get the best of the quintessential '80s sound right in your DAW. No shoulder pads or feathered hair required.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What’s Included?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Model 84 Polyphonic Synthesizer</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the lushness of the 1980s to today's Synthwave revival, the musical performance of this keyboard has helped it earn icon status. Softube's rigorous modelling of the voice modes makes for highly accurate voice allocation of chords and legato passages. The pitch and mod wheel, MIDI CC, and velocity/aftertouch support ensure it's an instrument that can be performed naturally. Use it to create the sounds this synth is so well-known for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/23098/content_model-84_1200x770.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 254px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Model 84 Chorus for Amp Room</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The super-smooth Model 84 module for Amp Room offers the powerful, dirty, and fat Chorus. The module is stellar for guitar processing and the creation of lush sounds for bass, guitar, and keyboards. Used in the original hardware and as inspiration for the design of the famous guitar stompbox, Chorus provides a “dirty chorus” sound that’s hyper-specific and prone to inciting outbursts of outrageous creative production ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/23100/content_model-84-whats-included-amp-room-module.png\" style=\"width: 150px; height: 313px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Model 84 for Modular</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Model 84 for Modular offers seven fully integrated instrument sections as individual modules. Ready to add to your Eurorack system, this legendary synth inputs pure creativity and inspiration with every module. It’s simple to combine single components of the synthesizer in a modular workflow to build patches—or one monster synth patch!—and get authentically retro polyphonic sounds. With Model 84, you can create combinations in Modular that were never-before-possible—via hardware or software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/23101/content_model-84-whats-included-modules.jpeg\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 488px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Modular Modules</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Chorus</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use the Chorus mode buttons to change the operational mode of the chorus (off, I, II). The Chorus Mono/Stereo Switch changes the output mode of the chorus between mono and stereo. Be careful with high-input signals. This module will distort just like the original hardware.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/23102/content_model-84-modules-chorus.jpg\" style=\"width: 120px; height: 383px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DCO</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The PW/PWM switch determines whether an external signal controls the pulse-width of the pulse waveform (when the PW/PWM switch is set to CV), or if the set slider position will define the manual pulse-width (PW/PWM set to MAN). The main output is combined output with the mixed waveforms (sawtooth, pulse, and sub-oscillator post-Sub Level). The output is about +- 7.5V when all the waves are summed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/23103/content_model-84-modules-dco.png\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 323px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Envelope</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gate input jack starts the envelope when high (triggers when crossing 2.5V on a rising flank) and initiates the release phase when set low again. The output envelope modulation signal of the envelope (0 - 10V when positive, 0 - -10V when negative) can be used to modulate VCA levels, LPF cut-off frequencies, or DCO pitch for bends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/23104/content_model-84-modules-env.png\" style=\"width: 120px; height: 388px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>LFO</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gate input jack triggers the delay fade-in period for the LFO waveform. When a positive gate signal is received here (crossing 2.5V on a rising flank), the LFO will reset to 0 and slowly fade-up by the rate set by the LFO delay slider. The output of the LFO triangular waveform of the Model 84 LFO at +-5V. Use this for vibrato.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/23105/content_model-84-modules-lfo.png\" style=\"width: 100px; height: 436px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Noise</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The slider sets the initial level of the noise when the CV jack is not connected and sets the scaling of the input signal when connected to an external modifier or modulator. The external CV input jack is used to externally control the level of the noise in the Model 84 Noise module. CV in at 0 to 5V will mimic the fader. Above this value will be clipped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/23106/content_model-84-modules-noise.png\" style=\"width: 100px; height: 432px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>VCA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Input the signal that you want to attenuate through the VCA via audio input. CV-in is the input for the external signal to control the VCA. Input CV 0 to 5V will mimic the fader. Anything above will be clipped. The level attenuator slider here sets the initial level of the Model 84 VCA when the CV jack is not connected and will set the scaling of the input signal when connected to an external modifier or modulator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/23107/content_model-84-modules-vca.png\" style=\"width: 100px; height: 440px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>LPF</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The keyboard CV input jack can be used for external keyboard modulation of the filter cut-off frequency. When the Keyboard track attenuator slider is set to full, the filter will track 1 v/octave via the Keyboard CV jack. The output jack of the Model 84 LPF module puts out the lowpass-filtered version of whatever signal is fed into the filter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/23108/content_model-84-modules-lpf.png\" style=\"width: 120px; height: 383px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The authentic sound of the 1980s in plug-in and module form</li>\r\n\t<li>Meticulously modelled on a pristine 1984 polyphonic synthesizer</li>\r\n\t<li>Three versions included: Model 84 Instrument, Model 84 Chorus module for Softube Amp Room, and seven Model 84 modules for Softube Modular.</li>\r\n\t<li>The unison phase sounds of the original</li>\r\n\t<li>Factory presets for easy recall of classic sounds</li>\r\n\t<li>Stunning artist presets—from classic sounds to contemporary, crispy leads</li>\r\n\t<li>Increased velocity and aftertouch support for added control over the amp, filter, and PW</li>\r\n\t<li>The addition of extended unison mode for higher control over sync</li>\r\n\t<li>An expanded control panel with added parameters for finetuning</li>\r\n\t<li>Pitch and mod wheel assignment, glide, and voice allocation for creative playing</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>System Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>macOS Big Sur 11, Monterey 12, Ventura 13</li>\r\n\t<li>Windows 10 (64-bit), Windows 11</li>\r\n\t<li>Softube account</li>\r\n\t<li>iLok account</li>\r\n\t<li>Computer with AU, VST, VST3, and/or AAX-compatible DAW host software</li>\r\n\t<li>Internet access (for downloading installers and managing licenses)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Supported CPU Families </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Apple macOS computers with Intel Core i3/i5/i7 or Apple silicon (M1 or newer) CPU.

But Softube Modular is more than just another virtual synthesizer plug-in—it's an entirely new modular synth standard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Infinitely Expandable </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a Modular owner, the basic system gives you a great toolkit to start out with. It includes six modeled Doepfer modules and over 20 utility modules. But there is much more to discover. Additional modules from quality Eurorack vendors—starting with a range of units from cutting-edge manufacturer Intellijel—are available for separate purchase. More modules will continuously be made available. Owners of Softube's drum synth Heartbeat can add its instrument and EQ modules to Modular and combine them with any other modules. Softube's award-winning engineering team have modeled each analog module, component by component, and the resulting plug-ins are sonically indistinguishable from their hardware counterparts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Welcome Experts &amp; Beginners </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experienced Eurorack synth users will be right at home from the start. Modular's workflow is very close to the use of physical Eurorack modular synths. Add modules, connect them using virtual patch cords, adjust their knobs and switches to your heart's desire. Get MIDI connectivity with the MIDI To CV/Gate Converter and add any of the included step sequencers—unless you prefer using your DAW's built-in sequencer, of course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To beginners, a modular synthesizer can be daunting at first. But Modular offers a wide range of expertly designed presets, immediately available to be put to use in your music. When you are ready to learn more about patching a Eurorack synth, the manual offers step by step patching tutorials that go hand in hand with the included tutorial presets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both experts and beginners will enjoy the included Performance modules.

{"title": "MonoPoly", "brand": "KORG", "url": "/product/1-Instruments/4-Synth/11197-MonoPoly", "rating": 5.0, "description": "<div itemprop=\"description\"><h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Reborn Through Software. 4VCO Synthesizer Mono/Poly</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The analog synthesizer Mono/Poly, which was launched at the same time as the Polysix in 1981, combined Korg’s analog synthesizers made until then into one ground-breaking synthesizer. Although this was a monophonic synthesizer with a thick sound made up of four voices, it had a groundbreaking specification of also being able to be used as a four-voice polyphonic synthesizer, which was extremely valuable as polyphonic synths were then expensive. It was famous for having the versatility of sound creation using 4 VCO (Voltage Controlled Oscillators) combined with Polysix, such as oscillator sync and cross-modulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the Mono/Poly V2 in this KORG Collection has been based on the software-emulated Mono/Poly from 2007, it has been refined for modern production environments. In addition to the much-requested high-resolution and scalable interface, KORG have added two new multi-effects. All of the analog sounds and behaviors are realistically reproduced by CMT, KORG’s proprietary electronic Circuit Modeling Technology, and this latest software brings the power and vintage vibes that you want in a plug-in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A Complete Reproduction of the Thick Sound of 4VCO</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mono/Poly has four VCOs with a dedicated envelope generator for the VCF, advanced chord memory and arpeggiator and has sync and cross-modulation functions that create revolutionary tone effects. It is a synthesizer that has received high acclaim for its ability to fine-tune its sound creation and unique sound character.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Mono/Poly of the KORG Collection faithfully reproduces the sound of the original Mono/Poly and behavior of its huge array of parameters with KORG’s proprietary electronic circuit modeling technology CMT (Component Modeling Technology). Instead of merely simulating the output sound as conventional modeling does, KORG’s CMT is a method for using digital equivalents of the transistors, capacitors, resistors, and other components found in the hardware realm to reconstruct the same signal path digitally. This perfectly reproduces the complex range of sounds and parameters that can only be created with the Mono/Poly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>High-Resolution Interface for Retina and 4K</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>KORG have made major GUI refinements to the KORG Legacy Collection ANALOG EDITION Mono/Poly software originally released in 2007. Its high-resolution graphics make it fit into modern Retina &amp; 4K environments and by supporting six levels of scalability, usability has been drastically improved. Enjoy features that are easy to use and give a sense of satisfaction which are unique to the Polysix and control many parameters such as patching, at a high resolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"393\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35763/original_757b246c434614291ab47863a9fb4383_pc.jpg\" width=\"600\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Maximum 128-Voice Polyphony, 16-Voice Unison</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The four key assign modes that let you freely use the mono and poly modes are the unique functions that the name Mono/Poly comes from. In addition to Unison, in which 4 VCOs are stacked, KORG have added CHORD which can memorize chord structures and let you play with one finger, and also Original, which distributes the four VCOs to four voices, Poly mode makes it possible to have polyphonic performances with all 4 VCOs stacked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8-Way Virtual Patches, 2 Multi Effects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 8-way virtual patch functionality lets you expand the characteristic versatile Mono/Poly sound to extreme limits. Using 159 different modulation sources, you can modulate up to 35 destinations, allowing you to create sounds that are more complex than those of the original synth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two new types of multi effects: Distortion with three types of switchable effects such as Valve Reactor, and Feedback, which has four types of switchable effects such as Reverb, Space, and Riser. This means there are 21 types of high-quality multi effects in total.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"396\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35764/original_8b6ec3f06c2ccccb910e7c93a4656dc8_pc.jpg\" width=\"600\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>300 Latest Presets</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>KORG Collection Mono/Poly V2 includes the 300 latest presets which showcase a wide variety of sounds unique to Mono/Poly, especially highlighting multiple analog synthesizer sounds.

Although track counts can number a hundred or more, often the core of a song is built around little more than a beat, a vocal, and a rich, living bass sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, an instrument dedicated to just that – tailored to producing huge, solid bass tones with complex, organic overtones, focused effects, and as much bass as you want when you build your own version in Modular for a mix-ready low end – is more than just useful. It’s foundational. Monoment Bass lays the groundwork for top-quality tracks every time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Stereo Soundscapes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of the source material in Monoment Bass was recorded in stereo from high-end rare and boutique synths, giving huge, wide, and mood-defining sounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Task-specific Effects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Including a purpose-built multi-band compressor, and a spatialization tool for fine-tuning your stereo image, Monoment Bass has great-sounding effects, but more importantly, the right effects for the job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Professional Presets</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amazing out-of-the-box sounds designed by Madison Mars, Vandalism, Sample Tools by Cr2, WA production, Black Octopus, and Function Loops, for finely tuned futureproof sounds from moment one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Use it in Modular</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Monoment Bass includes Source, Filter, and FX modules for Softube Modular so you can build your own bass synth with as many sources as you want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Modern Music, Modern Instrument</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Working with sound designer and rare-synth-collector Tobias Menguser, we set out on this project to tackle the vital problem of amazing-sounding, weighty bass parts in modern music. In so many modern styles, from pop and hip hop to club dance genres and electro music, the bass occupies more and more of the spectrum and does more and more of the heavy lifting in production terms. So we’ve provided a carefully selected and expertly curated collection of top-end sounds, paired them with easy-to-use and awesome-sounding synth architecture, and high quality analog effects for modern, mix-ready bass in seconds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Get Complex Quickly</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Monoment Bass includes a two-layer source section, with all-stereo sources offering rich and evolving sounds. Nothing is static, and all the sources were recorded in triplicate, so there are three different samples per key for additional naturalism and life. The resulting sounds leap out of the speakers and grab hold of your track. Right out of the box and with minimal tweaking, this instrument has authority, weight, heft, power, character. The filter, LFO, and amp are all geared to musicians – you don’t need a degree in synth-geekery to use Monoment Bass – and the effects are designed step-by-step for just this crucial task.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/15353/content_monoment-bass-story-2.jpeg\" style=\"height:225px; width:300px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Noise, Dirt, Magic</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using the aging knob, you can introduce a host of analog-ish imperfections to your bass sound. And a third noise source is available at all times, with multiple organic noise options, to add crunch to the attack or grit to the body of your sound. Add analog distortion, ambience, and tone-shaping in the effects section, and you’ll be surprised by the range of colorful living sounds your track can hold. Monoment, by virtue of its high input quality and carefully selected sculpting options, becomes more than a part of your mix. It’s the very core and heart of your mix.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/15354/content_monoment-bass-story-3.jpeg\" style=\"height:225px; width:300px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Modular Modules</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Monoment Source</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Monoment Source is the source engine from Monoment Bass as a stand-alone module. It has a built-in amplitude envelope, waveform mixing, dirt level, and aging. It can be played monophonically within modular over midi or monophonically via the gate and note jacks. The glide, punch, release, and aging parameters have external CV control via jacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21265/content_modules-monoment-source.jpeg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 300px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Monoment Filter</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Monoment Filter is the filter section from Monoment Bass as a stand-alone module. It has a built-in filter envelope and LFO. The envelope is triggered through the external gate jack. The slew, range, amount, and swing sequencer functions have external CV control. The LFO can be automatically locked to the DAW tempo or set to free running mode.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21266/content_modules-monoment-filter.jpeg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 300px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Monoment FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Monoment FX is the effects engine for Monoment Bass as a stand-alone module. It has four modes, drive, EQ, multi comp, and spatialization, that can be run one at a time. Up to three parameters in each mode have external CV control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21267/content_modules-monoment-fx.jpeg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 300px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>In short</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Super-high-quality bass synth with stereo source sounds from top-end boutique hardware</li>\r\n\t<li>Top-notch synth architecture that’s both versatile and easy to use</li>\r\n\t<li>Blend noise with two different sources at once for a textured and highly complex sound</li>\r\n\t<li>Professional presets from Madison Mars, Vandalism, Sample Tools by Cr2, WA production, Black Octopus, and Function Loops</li>\r\n\t<li>A heavy focus on modern bass sounds makes this the perfect addition to the forward-thinking studio</li>\r\n\t<li>Fills a soundstage with domineering weight and power, yet easy to mix thanks to dedicated effects</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>System Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>macOS Big Sur 11, Monterey 12, Ventura 13</li>\r\n\t<li>Windows 10 (64-bit), Windows 11</li>\r\n\t<li>Softube account</li>\r\n\t<li>iLok account</li>\r\n\t<li>Computer with AU, VST, VST3, and/or AAX-compatible DAW host software</li>\r\n\t<li>Internet access (for downloading installers and managing licenses)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Supported CPU Families </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Apple macOS computers with Intel Core i3/i5/i7 or Apple silicon (M1 or newer) CPU. Apple silicon is supported natively. </li>\r\n\t<li>Windows computers with quad-core Intel Core i3/i5/i7 or AMD quad-core processors with SSE 4.2 support.</li>\r\n\t<li>Other Intel processors (Celeron, Pentium, and Xeon) are compatible if they support SSE 4.2 instructions. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Supported Host Software (DAW)  </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any 64-bit VST, VST3, AU, or AAX (Pro Tools 11.0.2 or higher) compatible host application should work. However, due to plug-in host differences between DAWs—and our rigorous standards—Softube only officially test their plug-ins and instruments in the most recent versions of Pro Tools, Logic Pro, Cubase, Ableton Live, Studio One, and Reaper. Softube plug-ins are not tested regularly in non-listed systems. They will likely work if the system requirements are met. However, the manufacturer cannot guarantee a solution for issues in unsupported systems. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nSoftube strongly recommend using VST3, as some of their plug-ins have features that are not present in the older VST format. Supported sample rates: 44.1, 48, 88.2, 96, 176.4, and 192 kHz, in both mono and stereo. The most recent maintenance release of your DAW application is recommended. AAX DSP is not currently in active development. TDM/VENUE/RTAS are no longer supported. See Legacy Installers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Important Note: </strong>Make sure that you always use the latest iLok License Manager.

Novachord is based on the revolutionary polyphonic instrument from 1939, while Solovox replicates a related monophonic keyboard instrument intended to provide organ-style leads. These exceedingly rare instruments set standards for tone generation and synthesis techniques that continue to influence today’s electronic instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Notorious</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manufactured by the Hammond company from 1939 to 1942 and debuting at the World’s Fair, the Novachord contained 163 vacuum tubes and over 1,000 custom capacitors. Its divide-down oscillator architecture combined full 72-key polyphony with an early version of analog subtractive synthesis. The Novachord’s architecture predicted the ADSR envelope, utilized a resonant band-pass filter, and included a vibrato unit. These now-familiar methods resemble designs adopted decades later in Moog and ARP polyphonic synthesizers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite its historical importance, the Novachord did not enjoy commercial success. Although it resembled a standard organ at a glance, the front panel controls were not well-suited to the performance techniques of organists or pianists of the period. In addition, the numerous vacuum tubes were unstable, making the 500-pound instrument challenging to maintain. Production stopped in 1942 because of poor sales and parts shortages during the Second World War, with Hammond only manufacturing around 1,000 Novachords.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite its historical importance, the Novachord did not enjoy commercial success.

Based on the Novachord’s oscillator and divider circuits, the Solovox with 18 vacuum-tube Solovox was a small monophonic keyboard instrument attached beneath a piano keyboard and intended to augment it with organ-type lead voices. It consisted of two units: the three-octave mini keyboard, and a tone cabinet for the electronic sound generator, amplifier, and loudspeaker. Like the Clavioline and Ondioline, the Solovox produced a range of string, woodwind, and organ sounds and was widely used in light music from the 1940s and into the 1960s. Unfortunately, the introduction of compact transistor organs released in the 60s marked the end of the Solovox’s popularity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Out of the Past</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to their unique place in the history of electronic instruments, award-winning developer and DSP designer Mark Barton (MRB) presented Cherry Audio with the prospect of teaming up to revive these instruments and their unique mystical sounds. Armed with his enthusiasm and expertise in circuit-modeling, Cherry Audio set forth to recreate these masterpieces from yesteryear using virtual synthesis and no sampling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cherry Audio also received invaluable assistance from father and son, Joseph and Justin Fill, owners of a beautifully restored Novachord.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They didn’t stop at the sound -- the Novachord interface is a magnificent recreation of the original, replete with the white Plakson and black Bakelite keys, teardrop rotary levers, and gorgeous cherry wood. With Solovox, they went a step further, including responsive vacuum tubes that light up and respond to settings. With additional touches such as over 100 combined presets and flexible MIDI mapping, Cherry Audio has brought these Golden Age classics out of the past and into the 21st century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result is the Novachord + Solovox experience - a breathtaking feast for both the ears and the eyes, bundled together at one low price. Cherry Audio is overjoyed to bring these classic instruments back to life with these stunning software emulations.

Developed in partnership with The CAT’s original designer, Octave Cat retains all the growl of the original hardware’s fat, savage sound and replicates its aggressive resonant filter. Octave Cat features the flexible modulation, screaming audio-range oscillator cross-mod, and fierce oscillator sync of the original hardware, and extends it with expanded polyphony, a robust integrated effects suite, and a versatile dual-step sequencer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35082/content_octave-cat-ui-01.png\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 434px;\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1976: The Year of The CAT</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the early 1970s, portable synthesizers were a rarity, and only a select few musicians could afford the legendary Minimoog or ARP Odyssey synthesizers. Recognizing this, a small group of engineers in New York led by the brilliant 22-year-old Carmine Bonanno decided to shake things up and create affordable synthesizers with innovative features, giving birth to Octave Electronics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drawing from his own designs for a modular system, Bonanno and his team set out to create a synthesizer that was not only accessible to up-and-coming musicians but also boasted groundbreaking features. The result was The CAT synthesizer — an elegant and easy-to-program monophonic/duophonic synthesizer that offered an innovative combination of features including cross-mod, configurable sample and hold, extensive modulation, dual sub-oscillators, combinable waveforms, two types of oscillator sync, and a lowpass filter with uniquely powerful resonance. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even more revolutionary was the 1976 introduction price of only $599 - a game-changer for musicians who couldn’t afford more expensive alternatives. It also caught the attention of more affluent musicians, who praised its exceptional performance and versatility. Some of the biggest names in electronic music have used The CAT, including Devo, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, Dave Greenslade, Split Enz (notably for the keyboard break in their hit track, \"I Got You\"), and, more recently, The Prodigy and The Chemical Brothers. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the success of The CAT synthesizer, Octave Electronics introduced other products, such as the compact Kitten synthesizer and the coveted Cat Stick CV control box. Later, they merged with Plateau Electronics to become Octave-Plateau, and released the Voyetra Eight synthesizer and Sequencer Plus, the first successful MIDI sequencer software to run on the IBM PC platform. As Voyetra Technologies, software and hardware development enabled the company to thrive in the rapidly changing music tech industry. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, the company is known as <a href=\"https://www.turtlebeach.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Turtle Beach</a>, and it continues to innovate and create high-quality audio equipment and more. The CAT synthesizer remains an iconic piece of music technology, representative of Octave’s legacy of groundbreaking innovation and a relentless drive to make audio and music technology accessible to all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Octave Cat: A Curious Collaboration</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To preserve the legacy of this iconic synthesizer and provide today’s music producers with an ideal tool for production, Cherry Audio has added another life to The CAT with the introduction of Octave Cat. Cherry Audio Octave Cat expands upon the original with up to 16-voice polyphony, and adds a feature-packed “page two” with distortion, phaser, flanger/chorus, echo, and reverb effects, as well as a super-flexible dual eight-step sequencer capable of modulating numerous parameters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cherry Audio was thrilled to collaborate on Octave Cat with original designer and Octave Electronics founder, Carmine Bonnano. Expressing deep admiration for the outcome of this collaboration, Carmine notes that Octave Cat feels and sounds just like the real instrument. “Better yet,” he adds, “it goes way beyond what a hardware CAT is capable of. For instance, on a hardware CAT, you can’t save a patch, you can’t control modulation with an external MIDI controller, you don’t have full polyphony, etc.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to capturing the unique sonic character of the original, Cherry Audio added enhancements like sample and hold glide, step-sequencing, MIDI clock sync, a suite of effects, and more. “All of this,” says Bonnano, “makes the Cherry Cat incredibly more versatile than a hardware CAT.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cherry Audio spared no effort to ensure that the Octave Cat was crafted with the utmost respect and attention to the original instrument’s signature features. The result is a beautiful and fully realized piece of music technology that will undoubtedly find its way into the hands of countless music producers in the years to come. With Cherry Audio’s commitment to excellence and reverence for the original, the Octave Cat stands as a testament to the possibilities that arise when innovation meets tradition!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>All aspects of the original CAT precisely modeled in exacting detail</li>\r\n\t<li>Over 300 presets</li>\r\n\t<li>Dual Panel Views with an authentic Main view for synthesis controls, and an additional FX/Seq panel with extended features</li>\r\n\t<li>Monophonic, duophonic, and polyphonic (up to 16 voices) voice modes</li>\r\n\t<li>Unison for mono and duo modes</li>\r\n\t<li>Two distinct VCOs with discrete wave, modulation, S+H, and sub octave settings; VCO1 with saw, triangle, and pulse with PWM, and VCO2 with square and saw waveforms</li>\r\n\t<li>Vintage-correct four-pole 24 db/oct filter, based on the original “cascaded OTA” SSM2040 filter with precise replication of The CAT’s unique resonance</li>\r\n\t<li>Accurate reproduction of the original’s Transient Generators section with two envelope generators: a standard ADSR (attack/decay/sustain/release), and an AR (attack/release)</li>\r\n\t<li>Sample and Hold with VCO1, VCO2, or Noise as source, with Glide that slews the voltage steps for smoother transitions</li>\r\n\t<li>User-selectable Bend Depth, Octave Shift, and note Glide</li>\r\n\t<li>Tempo-syncable LFO with onset delay</li>\r\n\t<li>White noise generator</li>\r\n\t<li>Classic-style dual-channel, eight-step sequencer, independently assignable to oscillator pitches, filter cutoff frequency and VCA amplitude, with tempo sync, quantization, and keyboard transpose</li>\r\n\t<li>Studio-quality integrated effects: distortion with tube and fuzz, 2/4/8/12-stage phaser, flanger/chorus, three syncable delay types, and five reverb types</li>\r\n\t<li>Selectable original “Mark I” or later-style “SRM” skin</li>\r\n\t<li>Standalone virtual instrument and plug-in versions included</li>\r\n\t<li>Channel pressure and polyphonic aftertouch as a polyphonic modulation source</li>\r\n\t<li>Support for MIDI Polyphonic Expression (MPE) -- Pitch, Channel Pressure, and Timbre -- making Octave Cat capable of more organic and expressive performances when using MPE-compatible controllers</li>\r\n\t<li>Complete MIDI control and DAW automation for all controls, with easy-to-use MIDI learn and mapping</li>\r\n\t<li>Cherry Audio’s popular Focus zoom-in feature, as well as standard UI zoom and resize via drag</li>\r\n\t<li>Complete documentation available directly online from the instrument or in downloadable PDF format</li>\r\n\t<li>User-adjustable oversampling control</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>OCTAVE CAT is available in AU, VST, VST3, AAX, and standalone formats.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>System Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>macOS</strong></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">macOS 10.13 or above. macOS 13 Ventura supported.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">64-bit required.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Native Apple M1 processor support, including Apple M1 Ultra.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">3.4 GHz Quad-Core or M1 CPU with 8GB of RAM recommended.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Windows</strong></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Windows 7 or above (including Windows 11)</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">64-bit required</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Quad-core computer with 8GB of RAM recommended. </li>\r\n\t<li>Hard disk space: 21 MB</li>\r\n\t<li>Internet connection required for product activation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>"}

{"title": "PS-3300", "brand": "Cherry Audio", "url": "/product/1-Instruments/4-Synth/11377-PS-3300", "rating": 5.0, "description": "<div itemprop=\"description\"><h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">A Giant Japanese Monster</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>PS-3300 is an exactingly faithful virtual analog emulation of the colossal and ultra-rare semi-modular analog polyphonic synthesizer released by Korg in 1977. Cherry Audio has pulled out all the stops to accurately recreate and update this mythical monster synth, from its massive stacked sonic character and signature multiple‑resonator sweeps to the considerable patching capabilities that distinguished the PS-3300 from all other polysynths of the era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Big in Japan... and everywhere else</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before releasing its renowned line of MS monosynths, Keio Electronic Laboratories (under the KORG brand name) introduced its Polyphonic Series of analog synthesizers. The largest and most expensive was the massive PS-3300, a legendary synthesizer produced between 1977 and 1981. It is widely considered one of the most rare analog synthesizers ever made, with around 50 units produced. With its semi-modular design, flexible architecture, and a propensity for rich, sonically evolving timbres, the PS-3300 is often regarded as the holy grail of polyphonic analog synths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PS-3300's unique architecture set it apart from the handful of polysynths available at the time. It had three independent \"signal generator\" panels, each essentially a complete polyphonic synthesizer. Each of these synth panels included 12 independently tunable divide-down oscillator banks as well as independent discrete VCFs, envelope generators, and VCAs for every note. This enabled all 48 keys of the external keyboard to be simultaneously played with independent articulation. Dual LFOs and triple voltage‑controllable resonators for each generator further shaped its signature tone. A dedicated master panel featured a mixer with VCAs for each of the three voice panels, sample &amp; hold, an additional envelope generator, and two control voltage processors. It also delivered extensive modulation possibilities through an astounding 67 front-panel input/output jacks. Taken as a whole, the PS-3300 was so powerful and revolutionary that even Bob Moog was impressed, stating that it was, \"the best synthesizer for fat sounds.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The PS-3300's high production cost meant that only the wealthiest musicians could afford it, thus add ing to its rarity and mystique. Its broad and bold sound, described as an orchestra of synthesizers, has made it a highly sought-after instrument by professional musicians and collectors alike. Its adoption by groundbreaking artists such as Vangelis, Jean-Michel Jarre, Aphex Twin, Kraftwerk, Klaus Schulze, and Keith Emerson has further bolstered its popularity over the decades. Korg introduced the PS-3300 at $7,500 in 1977, and it is now so rare and coveted that one sold for nearly $100,000 in 2021!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Exactingly faithful virtual analog emulation of the semi-modular analog polyphonic synthesizer released by Korg in 1977</li>\r\n\t<li>Three independent \"signal generator\" panels, each with an oscillator, lowpass filter, three-peak resonators, envelope with velocity, amp, two mod generator LFOs, and per-note tuning:</li>\r\n\t<li>3X VCOs with six waveforms: triangle, saw, rectangle (square), two preset pulse waves (with different widths), and PWM (variable-width pulse)</li>\r\n\t<li>3X resonant VCF 12 dB/oct lowpass filters with the option to select between the standard \"clean\" PS filter or the \"crunchier\" MS-style filter</li>\r\n\t<li>3X three modulatable \"resonators\": 12 dB/oct bandpass filters to produce vowel and phasing tones</li>\r\n\t<li>3X discreet ADSR-type envelope modulators with velocity control, and amplitude modulation</li>\r\n\t<li>3X two syncable \"mod generators\" (LFOs) with output jacks: one with triangle, saw, ramp, rectangle, pink noise, and white noise, and the other with triangle waveform</li>\r\n\t<li>3X temperament section with individual tuning knobs for the 12 chromatic notes, and temperament presets for Equal Tempered, Mean Tone System, Hepatonal System, and Just Intonation</li>\r\n\t<li>Copy/paste settings from one signal generator panel to another</li>\r\n\t<li>Polyphonic mode with up to 24 voices of polyphony and three monophonic modes: last, low, and high note priority</li>\r\n\t<li>Semi-modular synthesizer with virtual jack and cable system, featuring unlimited mults per jack and customizable (color, transparency, animation) cables</li>\r\n\t<li>Master signal mixer panel with sample &amp; hold, general envelope generator, and two control voltage (CV) processors</li>\r\n\t<li>Individual channel panning</li>\r\n\t<li>User-selectable bend range and master tune</li>\r\n\t<li>Studio-quality integrated effects: chorus, echo with sync, and three types of reverb (spring, plate, and Galactic)</li>\r\n\t<li>Over 360 professionally designed presets in a dozen categories.

BT, Richard Devine, Inhalt, and more.</li>\r\n\t<li>Modular Ready: works as a native instrument plug-in and as modules in Modular, Softube's Eurorack platform.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In Stockholm, Sweden, there’s a synth emporium like no other – a store with such vibrancy, such range, such colour, that you’d need a dozen eyes and ears to take it all in. And the guy who runs it is no ordinary guy. He’s special, in all the best ways. His imagination fizzes and crackles with delight at the sounds of a million billion sparkling circuit boards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Out of this hotbed, this toy-box, this fantasy-factory, Parallels was born; an instrument with not one but two sound sources, each running painstakingly recorded and exquisitely calibrated multi-waveforms from every dream-machine must-have synth you could ever want, and sculpting the resulting sounds with the highest-quality Softube filters, modulators, and effects. If you’re looking for inspiration and sheer sound-quality in your music, this is your golden ticket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many possible approaches to take in creating a brand new instrument. Parallels focuses on two main things. First, it should always sound fantastic, with a minimum of fuss. And second, it should inspire the artist with elegant workflow, superb layout and visual feedback, and a sense of endless possibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A huge part of the first point is taken care of by the source material. Almost a hundred high-quality pre-recorded multi-waveforms live at the heart of Parallels. These come from classic synths, digital and analogue, hard-wired and modular, FM and phys mod, and from environmental and combined sources too. Even some super-rare and unreleased pieces are represented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each waveform has a progression of some kind in its 15-second duration – a filter sweep, or a pitch diffusion for example – and playback can start from any point of the artist’s choosing, providing almost infinite sounds-per-sound, even at the source. The playback method can be described as wavescanning, with pre-calibrated loop lengths per source for the best possible sonic outcome. The artist can choose how far the playhead will move through the source scene, and at what rate, before returning to its start point and settling into its sustain loop. All this with up to fourteen voices at once.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even just one of these source sections would be an intriguing instrument on its own. Parallels has two; independent and blendable in parallel; and much more besides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each source can pass through its own shaper section, for example, with a choice of three analogue-modelled filter types; a state-variable filter (low, high, or band-pass), a vactrol-style low pass gate, or a triad of resonant peaks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And what about the four ‘mod pods’ on the left! Each one can be filled by one of five modulator types (LFO, random, Euclidian sequencer, step sequencer, or envelope) and can modulate almost any parameter in the instrument, even pairing up to co-modulate single parameters in a blend amount selected by the artist. Apart from being utterly beautiful, the five modulation source options are versatile and intuitive, bringing all sorts of possibilities to the rest of the instrument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps best of all; the effects. Softube’s track record for rich, living effects in software is well-established. Many synthesizer effects are an afterthought. Ours have been our very essence for more than a decade. Parallels features five three-knob effects in sequence; individually adjustable, modulatable, and bypassable. A hot and hairy distortion precedes a chewy, tasty chorus. Then a flanger with stereo spread built into its feedback control. Finally delay, and a succulent purpose-built algorithmic reverb to kiss the output signal goodbye.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parallels is a software instrument like no other; a beautiful, intuitive, single-page interface concealing a wealth of treasures within. Created by dreamers, controlled by you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A plug-in soft-synth with dual wavescanning source sections</li>\r\n\t<li>Almost a hundred high-quality pre-recorded multi-waveforms</li>\r\n\t<li>Sonic progression within each waveform means near-infinite source-material</li>\r\n\t<li>Two parallel sources means blended sounds, opening up exponentially more possibilities</li>\r\n\t<li>Up to fourteen voices (seven per source when both sources are active)</li>\r\n\t<li>Hundreds of expertly-created presets from world-leading synth artists, engineers, and sound designers, including Brian Transeau a.k.a.

D16 have taken their critically acclaimed and successful Phoscyon 1 and completely re-designed the signal path. Now, they’ve achieved an unprecedented level of emulation accuracy, resulting in this new incarnation of the plug-in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Not Just One, But Every 303… Under Your Fingertips</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes, you might wonder why your 303 unit doesn't have as low a cutoff as you can hear on one of your favorite tracks…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diehard 303 fans know every 303 has a distinctive character, and now you can replicate that using Phoscyon 2’s Calibration Parameters. Not only do you have easy access to the familiar synthesis knobs, but you also get a backstage pass to the inner workings of the synth; D16 have included the service trim pots, originally designed for calibration, and some tweaks even owners of original the silver box couldn’t have dreamt of.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, it’s a gateway to an entirely new dimension of control and musical expression…</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Beyond The Original</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides the parameters you can find on the original 303, there are also a bunch of knobs that most of you know and love from popular mods and circuit bends within the 303 community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Vibrato Novelty</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You won't find this in even the most twisted 303 modifications out there… vibrato effect. Used only by a handful of 303 artists in their work, and achieved in a unique way. The original trick uses a two-note tremolo which is smoothed by note sliding, resulting in a distinctive 303-style vibrato. Phoscyon 2 replicates this process in a more intuitive fashion so you can achieve the sound with just two knobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The vibrato effect relies on two alternating notes rather than an oscillator, so the two-note spread decides vibrato range and the note duration dictates the speed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>State-Of-The-Art FX Chain</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every good 303 sound has a well-suited effects chain and, with Phoscyon 2, you can find a whole bunch of algorithms with acidic squeaks in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Distortion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Distortion is the most important effect in the chain. D16's implementation contains a selection of 19 distinctive-sounding models, based on famous hardware units that are notorious with the most recognizable 303 artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Reorderable Insert Effects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can shuffle effect order with ease to get extra flavors and make great-sounding riffs out-of-the-box.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Algorithmic reverb with independent settings for both early and late reflections</li>\r\n\t<li>4-band parametric EQ</li>\r\n\t<li>Delay with tempo sync option and in-loop multi-mode filter</li>\r\n\t<li>Chorus with two delay lines</li>\r\n\t<li>Limiter with compression characteristics: controllable knee, ratio, threshold and envelope</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Perfect Sequencer For Live Performers And Studio Producers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An entirely re-designed sequencer / arpeggiator makes the plug-in even more appealing. Edit patterns with ease and convenience, play them live in a loop and switch between them in whatever way you find most convenient – using a mouse, a MIDI controller or DAW MIDI notes to express your musical ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>See Where You Are With One Glance</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some hardcore 303 fans have learned to love the limitations of the original sequencer and now consider them part of their workflow. Others prefer a more modern approach to sequence editing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To meet the needs of both types of people, Phoscyon 2 features two different modes to control the sequencer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Music Roulette</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A new randomiser feature has been seamlessly integrated into the internal sequencer, allowing you to switch easily back and forth between randomizing a sequence and editing it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can decide which notes and step attributes are randomized with real-time density control for generated sequences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Live Override</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Give life to your patterns by influencing Accent, Slide or Vibrato while playing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Drag-And-Drop Export</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you’ve got the perfect pattern, you can seamlessly import it into your favorite DAW by simply drag-and-dropping it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A Variety Of Trigger Modes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use a pattern trigger mode that suits you: MIDI notes, MIDI CC or GUI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Arpeggiate To Get More Sophisticated And Deliberate Motives</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's not a typical, boring styled arpeggiator with few travel modes that generate the obvious note runs that are completely unpredictable while playing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You get an advanced tool where you can prepare a “template” of your riff that's a basis for more production-predictable sequences as the result.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Substantial Factory Content - over 800 presets and patterns out-of-the-box.</li>\r\n\t<li>Re-Sizable GUI - Several UI size options offer the perfect fit in your DAW screen and optimum workflow.</li>\r\n\t<li>MIDI Learn - MIDI Learn helps link almost any visible control to your MIDI controller, so you can let your creativity loose in the moment.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>System Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Mac</b></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>OS X 10.13 or newer</li>\r\n\t<li>CPU : Intel based 2.8 GHz (Intel Based 3.2 GHz recommended) / Apple Silicon M1</li>\r\n\t<li>8 GB RAM (16 GB Recommended)</li>\r\n\t<li>AU / VST2 / VST3 / AAX compatible host application (64bit)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PC</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Windows 7 or newer</li>\r\n\t<li>CPU : 3.0 GHz SSE (Multicore 3.7 GHz recommended)</li>\r\n\t<li>8 GB RAM (16 GB Recommended)</li>\r\n\t<li>VST2 / VST3 /AAX compatible host application (32bit or 64bit)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>"}

The original alphaSyntauri required an Apple IIe to operate, but Audio Damage have gone ahead and eliminated the middle-man so you can have this classic digital synth in your DAW of choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Version 3 once more modernizes the original's tried and tested feature set. Besides plenty under-the-hood improvements, it comes with a new coat of paint, expanded modulation options, MPE support, TUN-file support for non-equal-tempered tunings, and our brand new preset browser.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Oscillate!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phosphor’s topology closely follows the alphaSyntauri, while adding many modern features. It sports two identical voices, each with its own additive synthesis wavetable oscillator, noise source, amp envelope and delay line. Pick between low-resolution mode mirroring the original's sonics and the more pristine high-resolution setting for that top-end goodness. Keep it tame with 16 partials or cross-modulate Phosphor's oscillators and wade into the waters of the Synclavier's FM capabilities! <br>\r\nPhosphor accurately models the original's sounds while providing plenty new paths for sonic exploration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Modulate!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phosphor 3 features two LFOs with multiple waveforms, including a random source, which can be operated on a global or per-note basis. Their skew controls greatly expand the scope of available shapes, rendering them a powerful and flexible mod source. Phosphor 3's new modal modulation routing panel makes sound design a breeze: Assigning MIDI/MPE parameters, randomised modulation offsets or the LFOs and dialling in modulation amounts is ever only one click away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Express!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With its full MPE capabilities, Phosphor 3 teleports the classic that inspired it to the cutting edge of musical expression. Leverage modern controllers to breath life into yesteryear's patches and play them like never before! Are you the quirky type? Make Phosphor lose its temper and explore the world of non-standard tunings with its newly implemented TUN-file support! It's really got something for everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Share!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phosphor 3 is the first Audio Damage plugin first plugin to feature our brand-new preset manager. Organize your patches in folders and export them as zip-archives, ready for your preset-pack release. Import that fancy new set of patches you bought online directly from the plugin's GUI. Copy presets to your clipboard and quickly share them anywhere, or import a patch from your clipboard into Phosphor. Never has moving presets around been this easy. And the best of all: All this is entirely platform independent so you can use your patches anywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Two Voices:</strong> Each voice has a wavetable oscillator with transposition and fine-tuning controls, a noise generator, level ADSR, delay line with filter, and level and pan controls.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Additive Wavetable Oscillators: </strong>Each oscillator has 16, 32 or 64 partials with individual level sliders, preset buttons for common waveforms, and partial level randomisation.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Noise Sources:</strong> White noise in regular operation or shift-register noise in vintage mode. </li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>ADSR x 2: </strong>One level envelope for each voice with control over the duration and curvature of the Attack, Decay, and Release segments.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Vintage Modes:</strong> Introduces digital artefacts and distortion.

It is inspired by the expression and flexibility of the human voice but does not aim to cover all the aspects of an actual voice. Instead, it focuses on an organic and musical sound where the user has the possibility to control formants and dynamics seamlessly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The synth engine is a crossover between a wavetable- and a granulating synthesizer, which results in a very expressive and playable instrument. Instead of using ordinary samples or processing oscillators with formant filters, Pipa uses a large database of thousands of wavetables extracted from real vocal samples. The advantage of the technique being used is that it’s possible to seamlessly morph between wavetables with proper phase alignment. This enables Pipa to continuously make transitions between pitch, formants, and dynamics, which is very useful in a musical context.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Anatomy</h4>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/28105/content_anatomy12.PNG\" style=\"width: 770px; height: 250px;\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>1.

More than in other synthesizer, including those who propose switching between oscillators models. Icing on the cake, they can be dynamically modulated by many sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Let’s add:</strong> Two gorgeous, creamy multimode filters, self resonating in all modes, and Xils exclusive 0df technology. Three Analog modelled envelopes, with time multiplication, and looping capabilities. Two complex LFOs. They complete the picture to offer you this fat, warm and immediatly inspiring analog sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Per Voice!</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>It wouldn’t be a XILS-Lab instrument if it didn't have innovative &amp; exclusive features like the Per Voice modulation engines, or the giant Step Modulator, to propel it into the XXIth century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Make each note different:</strong> The Voice XY is a Per Note Quad XY modifier. You can control in a 2D square up to 4 different parameters to create from subtle to wild variations for each coming new note.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Control your Sound in 3D Space:</strong> With the Space XY module, you can place each note in a 3D True Stereo Space, and build stereo scenes that no additional external effect can achieve. Furthermore, you can make it move with chaotic functions, adding incredible life to your sounds. You have never had so much artistic control over the stereo field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you combine these two Per Note modifiers with the True Unison engine, you’ll soon get amazing, dense, and breath taking sounds, that will proudly take their place in a mix at once. And to operate it, you simply place and move balls, representing the voices, in a square. So easy, so immediate, so tempting, and so powerful!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hyper Modulations:</strong> The Polysequencer can now be used as a 128 steps, 4 lines/16 destinations giant Step Sequencer Modulator, allowing you to sculpt not only the most detailed TranceGate patterns, but also Slides or incredible rythmic patterns. Or everything together. Or something else, completely new.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More: </strong>Dynamic control of envelope segments &amp; levels, LFOs &amp; single oscillators levels. Polyphonic Arpeggiator &amp; Sequencer. Dozens of hardwired and user customisable Macros modulations. 5 monophonic &amp; polyphonic Play Modes. Syncable LFOs with cumulative waveforms, and reset switch. Polyphonic aftertouch. Midi Cc assignations to ALL parameters. Preset manager with customisable tags and multicriteria search engine. Vintage analog modelled Chorus, Delay, Phaser and EQ.Hundreds of presets made by the world’s best Sound Desingers.

With 3 Oscillators, the PolyKB III now enters the very private territory of vintage analog synths like the Minimoog. As the oscillators can morph continuously, and can also be controlled by all modulation sources rather than stay static (Triangle to Saw to Double Saw to Square to Pulse) you get endless possibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A double Hard Sync algorithm is on board (osc2/1 AND osc3/2). Finally, A 4th noise oscillator is there too, and Osc 2 &amp; 3 can also behave like LFOs… at audio rate of course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>2 Multimode Filters</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/6958/content_filter_pluginboutique2.jpg\" style=\"height:304px; width:117px\"></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two 0df Self Oscillating capable filters, with pre-post drive modules, direct Keyboard tracking, each with their own dedicated envelope for immediate tweaking. Multiple hardwired modulations. And multiple possible custom modulations as well : Total control</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each oscillator can feed Filter 1, or 2, or both. Filter can be cascaded (1 -&gt; 2). And you can perform filter morphing with any modulation source by controlling the filter ½ balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The filter is an essential part of each analog synth, but you’ll have to try the demo to get the feel of these ones, as nothing we could say can fully describe its creamy and precise character.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Custom Per Voice modulation, The Voice XY Pad Modulator:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/9372/content_pk3_voicexy.jpg\" style=\"height:216px; width:343px\"></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Per Voice modulator mean that each new note played will be affected by this modulator, and will sound different from the previous, and next ones.

When combined with the Polyphonic Integrated Sequencer you can build anything from ever-changing patterns to solid bulletproof analog sequences like in the ancient times.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou’ll also get some additional parameters that make full sense when playing music, like the possibility to control the speed of all Attack parameters with velocity ( Found in the Hardwired Matrix Modulation), or the Decay/Release of all envelopes. This is the key to expressive Keys or Brass/Strings patches, but you can use this to design rageous expressive leads as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additional parameters related to the envelopes are the 3 different Mono Modes, with low, high or last note priority. The Poly Circular and Poly Reset play modes are tied to the Voice XY and Space XY pads described above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>3 Envelopes &amp; 2 LFOs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/6959/content_envelopes_pluginboutique3.jpg\" style=\"height:302px; width:166px\"></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 3 analog modelled ADSR are hardwired to the VCA and both VCF.

A keyboard tracking is available for the enveloppes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, ADSR 2&amp; 3 can loop, or can be used as a LFO to complete the 2 main LFOs and the (synced) Sample &amp; Hold module. Enveloppes have a Time Multiply factor , to embrace all situations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The full featured LFOs can cumulate several waveforms, like a sine + a square, or a synced noise ( Sample &amp; Hold ) added to a Ramp Up. They have a fade in time, a delay time, and can be synced, to the host or internal clock. They also benefit from a reset/note on parameter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course LFOs can be polyphonic, or monophonic, so you can get both usual tremolo, vibrato and wha effects, while preserving a second Lfo for more subtle polyphonic modulations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Hardwired Macro Modulation - The Matrix</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/6960/content_pk3_mod1_pluginboutique4.jpg\" style=\"height:260px; width:343px\"></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hardwired modulations allow you to change the sound in a dynamic way by just establishing a connection (click on a switch) between different modules, then using the amount knobs. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The PolyKb III offers you more than 35 hardwired modulations, with various sources like LFOs, Enveloppes, but also oscillators or noise to perform AM &amp; RM, or Filter FM.

A gritty Moog-designed 24db Ladder Filter. An acoustic Filter Bank. And, finally, a character full Resonator Bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To take up the emulation gauntlet, more than two years were necessary to closely, patiently model these 71 components to finally come up with the best and most versatile Divided-down synthesiser ever done</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because XILS Lab not only exposed some parameters that were not accessible on the original machine, allowing you to dive into the machinery and mod it without a screwdriver, a soldering iron, and electronic components.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>XILS Lab has also added a more traditional analog VCA ADSR, a plethora of LFO to modulate almost everything, and a trio of vintage-sounding effects among others things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using divide-down technology offers a particular sound for Chords, Strings, and Pads you won't find in any other synthesiser.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this unit, feeding a monophonic zero-delay 24db self-oscillating filter, retriggered by keyboard strokes, gives you the possibility to play huge sounds in a way no other synthesiser can (PolyPedal behaviour emulated).

In this technology, a high-frequency oscillator is divided into 12 temperated scale intervals for producing a full octave, which is then divided by a multiple of 2 for creating several octaves. This means that all the notes are locked to a single oscillator and then always played with the same relative phase. This produces a particular sound aside from giving a wide polyphony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The PolyM reproduces finely this divide-down technology which has been pushed far by adding a polyphonic Pulse Width Modulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two top octave dividers oscillators can run independently in the FREE mode, for small or huge phasing effects. On the other hand, in the LOCK mode, the two oscillators are almost locked in phase, producing a phase modulation, instead of a frequency modulation when the square wave form is modulated in pitch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two T.O.D oscillators can be modulated in pitch by an LFO (tempo sync-able) and the Square oscillator has its pulse width modulated by an LFO (tempo sync-able too).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Keyboard is divided into two parts, Lower and Upper, and for each part, the PWM, waveform mix, and envelope decay can be tweaked independently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Master Gain control allows you to easily listen to various parts of the sound, DIRECT oscillator mixers output, through the MODE acoustic filters, through the RESonator filter bank, or through the 24db <strong>VCF</strong> filter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The envelope has two modes, LEGacy or ADSR.

{"title": "Polysix", "brand": "KORG", "url": "/product/1-Instruments/4-Synth/11195-Polysix", "rating": 5.0, "description": "<div itemprop=\"description\"><h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Reborn Through Software. Polyphonic Synthesizer Polysix</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Brought to the market in 1981, the analog synthesizer Polysix is one of KORG’s most famous synthesizers. At that time, popular synthesizers had a polyphony of five voices. This Polysix. with six polyphonic voices (one more voice), was named directly after the determination and pride of the engineers. Sound memory, built-in effects such as chorus, phaser, and ensemble are commonplace functionalities these days, but at the time, they were considered advanced specifications, and by combining them to deliver its unique fat sound the Polysix quickly became a worldwide bestseller.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the Polysix V2 in this KORG Collection has been based on the software-emulated Polysix from 2004, it has been refined for modern production environments. In addition to the often-requested high-resolution and scalable interface, they have added two new multi-effects. All of the analog sounds and behaviors are realistically reproduced by CMT, KORG’s proprietary electronic Circuit Modeling Technology, and you can now get these beautiful sounds, unique to the Polysix, as a state-of-the-art software plug-in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A Complete Reproduction Deep, Fat Polyphonic Sound of the Polysix</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With settings such as 1VCO / 1VCF / 1VCA / 1EG, Polysix has simple parameters. Due to its intuitive operation and chorus, phaser, and ensemble effects that spread the sound out evenly, the Polysix was highly acclaimed when first released in the 1980s, especially for its beautiful strings and pad sounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Polysix of the KORG Collection is able to faithfully reproduces the sound and performance of the original Polysix because of KORG’s proprietary electronic circuit modeling technology CMT (Component Modeling Technology). Instead of merely simulating the output sound as conventional modeling does, KORG’s CMT is a method for using digital equivalents of the transistors, capacitors, resistors, and other components used in the hardware realm to reconstruct the same signal path digitally. This accurately reproduces the complex range of sounds and parameters that can only be created with the Polysix.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>High-Resolution Interface for Retina and 4K</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>KORG have made major GUI refinements to the KORG Legacy Collection Polysix software (originally released in 2004) so that its high-resolution graphics allow it to work in modern Retina &amp; 4K environments. By supporting six levels of scalability, usability has been drastically improved. Enjoy features that are easy to use and give a sense of satisfaction which are unique to the Polysix and control many parameters such as patching, at a high resolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"411\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35761/original_ca976bfe5b749877194d8c47e3728719_pc.jpg\" width=\"600\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Two Newly Added Multi-Effects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>32 voices of polyphony and up to 16-voice unison (with detune/spread function) were added to the original (2004) Legacy Collection. Flexible external modulation settings and MIDI clock synchronization have also been introduced, allowing for sound production with a high level of flexibility and freedom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, the KORG Collection Polysix has two new multi-effects. The total of 21 effects such as compression, EQ, delay, reverb, and 127 kinds of ready-to-use effect programs expand the Polysix sonic range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"411\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35762/original_1ab041eb12eb04eb09107ad16900f84a_pc.jpg\" width=\"600\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>300 up to Date Presets</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original Polysix was a programmable 6 voice synth with memory patches, very unusual at the time. In addition to the presets of the previous KORG Legacy Collection Polysix, the latest, all new 300 presets have been added. KORG have included sounds that the Polysix excels at and is well known for, such as strings and pads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to being able to register sounds that you like as favorites for immediate recall, there is a new convenient program browser so you can narrow sounds down by type, allowing you to quickly find the sound that you are looking for.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Faithful modeling of the Polysix circuitry.</li>\r\n\t<li>Proudly digitized using KORG’s Component Modeling Technology (CMT).</li>\r\n\t<li>High-resolution interface for Retina and 4K.</li>\r\n\t<li>Two newly added multi-effects.</li>\r\n\t<li>300 new presets.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>System Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mac</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Mac OS X 10.14 Mojave or higher (latest update)</li>\r\n\t<li>Intel Core i5 or better (Core i7 or better recommended) (<strong>Apple Silicon Native supported)</strong>\n</li>\r\n\t<li>8 GB RAM (16 GB or more recommended)</li>\r\n\t<li>8 GB free disk space (SSD recommended)</li>\r\n\t<li>AU, VST, VST3, AAX (Supported 64bit plug-ins only)</li>\r\n\t<li>An internet connection is required</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PC</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Windows 10 64bit or higher (latest update)</li>\r\n\t<li>Intel Core i5 or better (Core i7 or better recommended)</li>\r\n\t<li>8 GB RAM (16 GB or more recommended)</li>\r\n\t<li>8 GB free disk space (SSD recommended)</li>\r\n\t<li>VST, VST3, AAX (Supported 64bit plug-ins only)</li>\r\n\t<li>An internet connection is required</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>"}

Defined by the cutting edge digital signal processing technology and a DSP chip formerly used exclusively for effects processing, the Prophecy Solo Synthesizer is now available as a software plugin, with the ease of use, polyphony, and modern features necessary for today’s music production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A Further Evolution in Expression</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>KORG Collection - Prophecy, a legendary physical modeling synthesizer developed with the aim of offering freedom of expression beyond analog synthesizers and unprecedented sound creation possibilities, has evolved even further in its expressive capabilities. In version 1.5, the quirks of the hardware Prophecy can now be expressed even more precisely thanks to deeper creative input from the brilliant minds in the original Prophecy development team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Version 1.5 also adds 180 new programs. This unique sound collection brings out the individuality of the Prophecy, ranging from fresh, software-only sounds to those that pay homage to the original Prophecy and pushes monophonic sound design to all new levels. Please enjoy the new programs created with the participation of the original Prophecy sound designers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Equipped with Oscillator Models from the MOSS Synthesis Engine</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prophecy for Mac/Win uses software to fully reproduce the original Prophecy’s MOSS (Multi-Oscillator Synthesis System) and is equipped with five of the seven total oscillator types.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"372\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35783/original_96d0e2d11b4f4ce3cb0da5936bb4c324_pc.png\" width=\"600\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Standard Oscillator for Analog Synth Sounds</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a simulation of analog synth oscillators and is also equipped with Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), expanding the timbral capabilities beyond what is normally possible in analog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"372\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35784/original_61ce85a66a05b36cc00dba3035249ca7_pc.png\" width=\"600\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Noise + Comb Filtering</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This oscillator extracts tone components from white noise. Contrary to what some might think, this algorithm is capable of more than just noisy sounds. It offers a wide range of possibilities, from synthy basses to strings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"372\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35785/original_6caa8e704f2debbd723f4c19ad689693_pc.png\" width=\"600\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>VPM (Variable Phase Modulation)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>VPM creates rich harmonics by modulating the phase of a signal. The carrier’s phase is changed by the modulator, and the resulting signal is processed by the wave shaper, resulting in sounds with high frequency content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"372\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35786/original_fa9ea3bcb2a40c1ff9019261c6d695c8_pc.png\" width=\"600\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cross / Ring / Modulation and Sync</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This oscillator is designed to replicate analog oscillators modulating one another. As a result, it can produce chiming, metallic sounds with rich harmonics like bells.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"372\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35787/original_6d373d8d1be780a726cb1efa53d0758b_pc.png\" width=\"600\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Physical Modeling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The physical modeling oscillator includes the three types below. All types feature the wide tonal range that is unique to physical modeling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Brass Model Oscillator</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This oscillator simulates brass instruments such as trumpets and trombones. It uses controllers like key velocity and mod wheel to modulate the strength of blowing into the mouthpiece, and can create performances that are similar to real brass instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Reed Model Oscillator</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This oscillator simulates woodwind instruments like saxophones and flutes. It uses controllers like key velocity and mod wheel to modulate the wind pressure, and can create performances that are similar to real woodwind instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Plucked String Oscillator</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This oscillator simulates plucked string instruments like guitar and bass. It can model different methods of picking the string, like using a pick or fingers, as well as modelling the condition of the strings, and the positions of strings that are played.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sounds from each oscillator model can be processed using a nonlinear wave shaper. Using one of the two types, CLIP or RESO, the oscillator output can be completely mangled. The original waveform can also be mixed to make a wide range of sounds, from mildly processed to completely unrecognizable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the oscillator and wave shaper sections, there is also a sub oscillator and noise generator. These different outputs can be independently combined in the two mixer sections for the two different outputs. The amp section can also be fed back into the corresponding mixer for even more tonal possibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MOSS synthesis enables a very wide range of sound making. From the multi-oscillator Z1 synthesizer capable of polyphony and equipped with an X/Y pad, to TRINITY and TRITON’s polyphonic MOSS boards and even the OASYS and KRONOS, KORG’s physical modeling technology all started here, with the Prophecy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"372\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35788/original_263bb5e62ccb74dc9cc4bc9ec6165b33_pc.png\" width=\"600\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sound Programs that Cover a Wide Range of Style</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are 128 preset programs, broken up into 14 categories. There is also a category for user programs, a favorites bank for registering your most used sounds, and program change mapping. The two optional expansion cards sold for the original hardware are also available: ANALOG &amp; VINTAGE, which features 64 analog-style bass, lead, and special effect sounds, and MODERN MODELS, which contains 64 programs of acoustic instruments that do not exist, wind instrument sounds, and sounds that take full advantage of the expressive capabilities of the synth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"372\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35789/original_6be57741dc042d69bf9cd4bf874d890c_pc.png\" width=\"600\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GUI with a Focus on the Ease of Use Unique to Software</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Prophecy for Mac/Win GUI (Graphical User Interface) is divided into three sections: SYNTH, FX, and ARP.

In addition, the controls now have indicators to show modulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Additional VA Oscillator</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quanta 2 has two virtual analog oscillators instead of the single one in the original. Use one for a sub bass, send both to the grain engine, granularize one and leave the other normal -- whatever floats your boat!</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/31507/original_main_q2_02_900x900_pluginboutique.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 338px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Root Note Detection And Assignment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you drop a sample on Quanta 2, or load it via the import dialogue, Quanta 2 attempts to find the root note of the sample. (This obviously works better on legato single notes than it does on chords or full music loops.) After the import, you can adjust the root note to taste.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Grain Pitch Quantization</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can optionally limit grain pitches to particular notes. This quantizing is post-modulation, so any randomization or mod applied to grain tuning will be quantized to the scale of your choosing. Quantizing respects the tuning table or MTS-ESP tuning as well. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Effects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quanta now has a chorus, stereo dual delay, and reverb taken from the Audio Damage library of studio effects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>New Modulation Features</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The envelope generators and LFOs have been extensively improved. The FEGs pick up amplitude and time scale knobs, and the FLFOs get amplitude control, switchable bipolar output, and a sync switch which causes FLFO 2 to reset whenever FLFO 1 restarts. In addition, four Macro knobs have been added to the modulation panel, and these can receive a global MIDI CC assignment, thus allowing you to control the macros from the MIDI controller of your choice, no matter what the author of the preset chose. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Quanta 1 Preset Loading</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quanta 2 contains every preset from Quanta 1, and every post-release pack they have commissioned, as well as new preset packs from Red Means Recording and Red Sky Lullaby, and created in house. In addition, Quanta 2 will load any preset created for Quanta 1. If you have made presets for Quanta 1, just drag the folder in to the Quanta 2 preset user folder, and they will appear in Quanta 2 ready to go to work. </p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/31506/original_main_q2_03_900x900_pluginboutique.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 339px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Multi-Format Sample Loader</strong> - Quanta 2 can load AIFF, WAV, Broadcast WAV, FLAC, MP3, and Ogg in any sample rate, bit depth, and channel configuration. It automatically converts the sample to the session's sample rate, and attempts to find the root note.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Grain Engine</strong> - Up to 100 simultaneous grains per voice, of up to 1 second long, with control over grain rate, pitch, direction, shape, length, panning, source position, and level.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Two Virtual Analog Oscillators</strong> - Continuously variable wave shape, with pulse width modulation, and independent control over pitch (separate from grain engine.) Can be injected directly into grain engine. </li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Noise Source</strong> - Noise source features a \"color\" control that affects tonal characteristics of the noise. Can be injected directly into grain engine. </li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Dual Multi-Mode Filters</strong> - Filters can be used in serial or parallel modes, and include lowpass, highpass, bandpass, and notch in 2-pole and 4-pole configurations. </li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Flexible Envelope Generator (FEG) x 4</strong> - The four FEGs are arbitrary function generators, with up to 99 steps, curve and step level control, arbitrary loop points, and host tempo sync. </li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Flexible Low-Frequency Oscillator (FLFO) x 2</strong> - The pair of bipolar FLFOs utilize five controls (amplitude, phase, shape, skew, and warp) to access a virtually limitless palette of waveforms, and feature host tempo sync and retrigger. </li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Sample And Hold</strong> - The S&amp;H mod source can sample noise (random) or any of the other mod sources, at either a user-defined rate or a musical division.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Modulation Menu</strong> - Every mod and MIDI source can be easily and simply assigned to any destination with the right-click context menu.

In addition, the controls now have indicators to show modulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Additional VA Oscillator</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quanta 2 has two virtual analog oscillators instead of the single one in the original. Use one for a sub bass, send both to the grain engine, granularize one and leave the other normal -- whatever floats your boat!</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/31507/original_main_q2_02_900x900_pluginboutique.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 338px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Root Note Detection And Assignment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you drop a sample on Quanta 2, or load it via the import dialogue, Quanta 2 attempts to find the root note of the sample. (This obviously works better on legato single notes than it does on chords or full music loops.) After the import, you can adjust the root note to taste.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Grain Pitch Quantization</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can optionally limit grain pitches to particular notes. This quantizing is post-modulation, so any randomization or mod applied to grain tuning will be quantized to the scale of your choosing. Quantizing respects the tuning table or MTS-ESP tuning as well. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Effects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quanta now has a chorus, stereo dual delay, and reverb taken from the Audio Damage library of studio effects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>New Modulation Features</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The envelope generators and LFOs have been extensively improved. The FEGs pick up amplitude and time scale knobs, and the FLFOs get amplitude control, switchable bipolar output, and a sync switch which causes FLFO 2 to reset whenever FLFO 1 restarts. In addition, four Macro knobs have been added to the modulation panel, and these can receive a global MIDI CC assignment, thus allowing you to control the macros from the MIDI controller of your choice, no matter what the author of the preset chose. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Quanta 1 Preset Loading</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quanta 2 contains every preset from Quanta 1, and every post-release pack they have commissioned, as well as new preset packs from Red Means Recording and Red Sky Lullaby, and created in house. In addition, Quanta 2 will load any preset created for Quanta 1. If you have made presets for Quanta 1, just drag the folder in to the Quanta 2 preset user folder, and they will appear in Quanta 2 ready to go to work. </p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/31506/original_main_q2_03_900x900_pluginboutique.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 339px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Multi-Format Sample Loader</strong> - Quanta 2 can load AIFF, WAV, Broadcast WAV, FLAC, MP3, and Ogg in any sample rate, bit depth, and channel configuration. It automatically converts the sample to the session's sample rate, and attempts to find the root note.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Grain Engine</strong> - Up to 100 simultaneous grains per voice, of up to 1 second long, with control over grain rate, pitch, direction, shape, length, panning, source position, and level.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Two Virtual Analog Oscillators</strong> - Continuously variable wave shape, with pulse width modulation, and independent control over pitch (separate from grain engine.) Can be injected directly into grain engine. </li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Noise Source</strong> - Noise source features a \"color\" control that affects tonal characteristics of the noise. Can be injected directly into grain engine. </li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Dual Multi-Mode Filters</strong> - Filters can be used in serial or parallel modes, and include lowpass, highpass, bandpass, and notch in 2-pole and 4-pole configurations. </li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Flexible Envelope Generator (FEG) x 4</strong> - The four FEGs are arbitrary function generators, with up to 99 steps, curve and step level control, arbitrary loop points, and host tempo sync. </li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Flexible Low-Frequency Oscillator (FLFO) x 2</strong> - The pair of bipolar FLFOs utilize five controls (amplitude, phase, shape, skew, and warp) to access a virtually limitless palette of waveforms, and feature host tempo sync and retrigger. </li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Sample And Hold</strong> - The S&amp;H mod source can sample noise (random) or any of the other mod sources, at either a user-defined rate or a musical division.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Modulation Menu</strong> - Every mod and MIDI source can be easily and simply assigned to any destination with the right-click context menu. Just right click, and add and remove all mod sources.  </li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Microtuning With Tuning Tables And Global Tuning Offset</strong> - Re-tune Quanta 2 to new intonations and temperaments with native support for ODDSound's MTS-ESP session-wide tuning system. Alternatively, load tuning tables in the open-source and easy-to-use TUN file format. A global tuning offset (default to A=440) allows you to easily retune the entire synth to match a different A frequency without using a tuning table. </li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>MPE (MIDI Polyphonic Expression)</strong> - Quanta 2 understands both \"legacy\" MIDI and MPE.

At its core, RANDOM employs AI and neural network principles to birth an infinite array of utterly unique sounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Central to the experience is the transformative power of the RANDOM wheel, a gateway to two distinct systems: the Synth and the Resonator. Through hundreds of parameters, DEVIANCE, determines the extent of randomization with each spin of the wheel. As notes are struck, INSTABILITY introduces an element of unpredictability, shaping the variance between each note. You can visually see the wheel moving as DEVIANCE kicks in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unleash your creativity with the RANDOM plugin, a testament to the boundless potential that arises when genius meets innovation. Elevate your music, and let the limitless soundscape of RANDOM be the catalyst for your next sonic masterpiece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sonic landscape is further sculpted by the influence of STRESS, dictating the decay length of the synth. Meanwhile, the SPIKE control imparts an aggressive quality, with darker, warmer tones on one end and a more assertive, edgier palette on the other. BLEED and FLUID provide a delicate dance of influence over the resonator, allowing for nuanced modulation of color and presence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The PARAMETER LOCK buttons empower users to anchor specific settings, granting the freedom to fine-tune other elements without disturbing the carefully crafted foundation. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dive even deeper into the creative journey with the meticulously curated TABLES AND PRESETS, each a testament to Phazz's artistry. Within these X/Y Tables, a treasure trove of handcrafted timbres awaits, driven by AI models that seamlessly morph between points as your cursor traverses the digital canvas. Here, the MATTER comes alive, pulsating within the 2 dimensional table, guided by the very essence of Ferrofluid dynamics - attraction and repulsion - responding intuitively to your creative touch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RANDOM's synthesis transcends the conventional, It's a symphony of data-driven artistry, where Neural Networks  orchestrate the dance of high-dimensional parameter vectors within a 2 dimension TABLE. Together, they navigate the intricate terrain, revealing a world of sonic possibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>System Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Windows</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Windows 10</li>\r\n\t<li>2GHz Pentium IV processor or equivalent</li>\r\n\t<li>A host that supports 32-bit or 64-bit VST</li>\r\n\t<li>At least 16MB free disk space</li>\r\n\t<li>Formats: VST, VST3</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>macOS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>macOS 10.15 Catalina or later</li>\r\n\t<li>Intel or Apple Silicon processor</li>\r\n\t<li>A host application that supports 64-bit VST or AudioUnit</li>\r\n\t<li>at least 52MB free disk space</li>\r\n\t<li>Formats: AU, VST, VST3</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Please note for users of FL studio:</strong> Turn on the ‘Use fixed size buffers’ option in the ‘Troubleshooting’ tab of the plugin settings.</p>\r\n</div>"}

Armed with this list and several more brainstorming sessions later, Rob Papen and his development team created a powerful new virtual synth RAW.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RAW has two oscillators each with an X/Y field, (as included in Blade and BLUEII) to distort the waveform using Phase Distortion. But that's not all, you can also draw two of your own 'waveforms' and use them as LFO waveforms enabling the creation of unique 'wobble' movements that are perfect for for DubStep and other electronic music styles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RAW has all the great Rob Papen filters to shape your sound further, but in a refreshing twist, 'EQ', ‘Waveshaper', 'Distortion' and 'LoFi' have also been added on a voice synthesis level. Other FX such as Chorus, Phaser, Flanger, Stereo delay and the amazing HQ Reverb of Rob Papen can all be added to your sound and of course, the cool Arpeggiator/Sequencer, Easypage and preset bank manager have all been included as standard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In true Rob Papen style, RAW comes with many great presets with mainly contributions from several well known DJs and Producers for instant user inspiration!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Promo, Ophidian, Mad dog, Deathmachine, D-Passion, Rob Fabrie, DJ Thera, N-Vitral, Tha Playah, DJ Hidden, The Viper, Warface and many more...</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>New Features include:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Analog drift on/off button</li>\r\n\t<li>Drag and drop modulation</li>\r\n\t<li>Right menu on dial expanded with modulation routing option</li>\r\n\t<li>Improved Reverb code</li>\r\n\t<li>Path options, to change the order of modules or the fx modules</li>\r\n\t<li>Extra Pre filter distortion inside</li>\r\n\t<li>Filter Bank manager now has the 'star' feature, for easily finding your favourite preset</li>\r\n\t<li>Over 750 extra presets (now around 3000 in total!)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Now NKS Compatible!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/16676/content_nks_pluginboutique.png\" style=\"height:100px; width:100px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>System Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PC</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Windows 7/ Windows 8/ Windows 10 (32 &amp; 64 bits)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Formats:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>VST</li>\r\n\t<li>AAX (Note: PC AAX for PT 12 or higher)</li>\r\n\t<li>Compatible with NI NKS system</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mac</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>OS-X 10.9 - 10.15 (64 bits only)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Formats:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>AU</li>\r\n\t<li>VST</li>\r\n\t<li>AAX</li>\r\n\t<li>Compatible with NI NKS system</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Serial/licence system with activation whilst registering the product</li>\r\n\t<li>2nd serial for a secondary computer/laptop is available after you have registered the product’s original serial/license.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>"}

It’s an emulation of the Yamaha YM2612 sound chip, best known for being the vibrant voice of the Sega Genesis/Megadrive videogame console. More than a simple sound-alike, the emulation is cycle-accurate to the original chip, that allows reproducing every unique possibility of the synth. On top of this, the amp circuitry of the console has been reproduced too, in order to obtain the same grain you'd get if you plugged the real hardware into your DAW.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/16141/content_rym2612-render-pluginboutique.png\" style=\"height:320px; width:600px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Cycle-accurate emulation of the YM2612 FM soundchip</li>\r\n\t<li>Genuinely reproduces the unique and characteristic sound of its hardware counterpart (digital saturation, huge feedback amount, natural distortion, …)</li>\r\n\t<li>Audio input for adding 8-bit PCM sweetness to any signal</li>\r\n\t<li>Low CPU usage</li>\r\n\t<li>Switchable output filtering and ladder effect</li>\r\n\t<li>A couple of limitations from the soundchip have been taken away: up to 16 voices of polyphony, dedicated PCM channel (you can of course stick to 6 simultaneous voices if you want to experience the real thing)</li>\r\n\t<li>100+ various, sorted, evocative patches to start with</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/16142/content_hedgehog.png\" style=\"height:280px; width:200px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The 16-bit Legacy</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not many people were aware of this, but unlike other videogame consoles, the Sega* Genesis/Megadrive had a complete FM synth onboard.

This simple architecture is comparable to classic analog synths, making it ultra-accessible despite its complex sound. And, just like the original, you can explore unique hard sync and AM (amplitude modulation) configurations to unlock more abstract sonic behaviour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Analogue Output</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where digital meets analog, magic happens. SQ80 V features a meticulously modelled Curtis CEM 3379 chip that provides the beautifully warm resonant analog filter and stereo amplification stage. Better still, Arturia implemented subtle analog dispersion to reproduce the nuanced ever-changing behaviour of analog circuitry for a truly organic sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Movement and Modulation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ensoniq’s instruments were known for providing a more familiar synth architecture than many of their digital peers, closer to that of an analog synth in many ways. SQ80 V replicates and enhances this familiarity in detail so you can craft your own evolving, pulsing, and rhythmic sounds in no time: 4 multimode polyphonic envelope generators, 3 LFOs with 6 waveforms, 8 MIDI sources, and even a dynamic modulation mixer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What Was Added?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>SQ80 V strikes the perfect balance between the ‘80s cult classic and modern production workhorse with character.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To achieve this, Arturia added hundreds more waveforms and retrofitted its architecture with a number of extra creative features - without compromising its distinct retro charm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Arpeggiator</strong> - Introducing an arpeggiator to SQ80 V’s curious sound equips it for easy performance and melody creation. A classic component with the familiar controls, including arp direction, sync, octave range, and hold. Just turn it on and enjoy free-flowing lo-fi sounds that fit right into your mix.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Unison</strong> - SQ80 V offers up to 16-voice polyphony - twice that of the original hardware instrument - but Arturia couldn’t resist adding an 8-voice unison option. Stack up those oscillators for enormous basses, gritty percussion, and ultra-dense lead sounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dispersion</strong> - When it comes to classic synths and keyboards, the true charm often lies in the details. Arturia went a step further than emulating the SQ80’s sound and interface by introducing dispersion - meaning subtle variations and inconsistencies in the behaviour of its emulated circuitry. No two notes will ever be exactly the same, bringing a truly unmatched organic sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Envelopes Expanded</strong> - To further shape the attack, duration, and evolution of your sounds, Arturia upgraded SQ80 V with 2 additional envelope modes: DADSR and MSEG. The former adds a delay stage to the traditional ADSR for staggered strikes and interesting rhythmic patterns. The latter is a fully customizable looping function generator for painting envelopes your own way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Mod Mixer </strong>- Combine any 2 modulation sources, from envelopes to keyboard controls, to distort, mangle, and refract your patches in interesting and unexpected ways. With 6 different modes of modulation mixing, the combination possibilities are enormous - as are the potential sonic results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MPE Compatibility </strong>- SQ80 V supports MPE-compatible controllers for an advanced expressivity experience. Create dynamic performance patches and textures that can respond in numerous ways to a single keystroke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Presets</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enjoy perfect tailor-made sounds from the offset with SQ80 V’s expertly designed library of 160 presets, including 40 replicated from the original instrument.

Employing four sine-wave oscillators, Sines utilises diverse waveshaping methods to bend these basic waves into infinitely variable and complex shapes. When combined with its wide-ranging modulation capabilities and effects, users can create a diverse array of unique timbres ranging from the sublime to sizzling.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/32091/content_sines-ui-02_plugin_boutique.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 299px;\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Power of Four</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state-of-the-art Sines interface provides immediate hands-on access to all sound parameters. It comes alive with illuminated indicators, colour, and mini oscilloscopes, providing instant visual feedback. The primary sound design controls are grouped horizontally in bands emphasizing its \"four of everything\" nature: four LFOs, four oscillators, and four envelope generators. At the core of each section are the unique sine-wave oscillator waveshaping controls: feedback, phase, width, shape, wavefold, and drive, along with a sub (octave-down) oscillator and a super (octave-up) oscillator. Phase modulation and ratio dials allow the oscillators to be configured in a modulator/carrier arrangement for four-op DX/FM-style synthesis. But these dangerous curves are just the beginning. Sines features Cherry Audio's most extensive multimode filter to date, four LFOs with 14 wave shapes, four envelope generators, an arpeggio, a \"best of\" selection of Cherry Audio's finest acclaimed effects, a drift function, and an integrated eight-band graphic EQ. Many controls include an adjacent mod source button, and an outrageously comprehensive four-slot mod matrix provides numerous modulation options for nearly every Sines parameter.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/32092/content_sines-ui-03_plugin_boutique.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 299px;\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Three Ways to Play</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mastering Sines may seem like rocket science, but Cherry Audio have made it easy to get started. Sines includes over 500 presets, both practical and cutting-edge, as well as a comprehensive user guide that's fun to read. Moreover, the aural and visual immediacy of Sines encourages experimentation and provides a deeper understanding of how the elements interact. In little time, users can design individualised sounds ranging from glorious evolving pads, to bright FM plucks, distinctive leads, crisp percussive tones, and much more. Sines lends itself well to three more direct approaches to sound design: standard subtractive synthesis, where sine waves are wave-shaped into other familiar waveforms, then processed through an analog-style filter. Alternately, an additive synthesis approach stacks sine waves at different pitches and amplitudes, like a supercharged Hammond tonewheel organ. Finally, oscillators can modulate each other in multiple configurations, mimicking the classic DX-style FM carrier and modulator architecture with much less effort than original 80s instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/32093/content_sines-ui-04_plugin_boutique.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 299px;\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Four independent sine waveform oscillators, with waveshaping controls to bend the basic waves into other standard waves (sawtooth, square, pulse, triangle) and more complex and novel shapes</li>\r\n\t<li>Six waveshaper controls: feedback, phase, width, shape, wavefold, and drive, each with modulation source assignments available</li>\r\n\t<li>Sub (octave-down sine wave) oscillator and a super oscillator (octave-up sine wave) for each oscillator</li>\r\n\t<li>Oscillator utility function to copy/paste, randomise, or reset any oscillator settings</li>\r\n\t<li>Glide (portamento) and keyboard (pitch) controls independently enabled for each oscillator</li>\r\n\t<li>Up to 16-voice polyphony</li>\r\n\t<li>Polyphonic (two modes), chord memory, single voice, and unison with unison detune</li>\r\n\t<li>Resonant multimode filter with 6, 12, 18 or 24 dB/oct lowpass, highpass, bandpass, or notch modes</li>\r\n\t<li>Four tempo-syncable LFOs with 14 waveforms: sine, triangle, sawtooth, sawtooth, exponential sawtooth, logarithmic sawtooth, three-step sawtooth, four-step ramp, exponential ramp, logarithmic ramp, three-step ramp, and four-step square random</li>\r\n\t<li>ADSR filter and amplifier envelope generators with velocity controls</li>\r\n\t<li>Two additional auxiliary envelope generators usable as mod sources</li>\r\n\t<li>Four-slot mod matrix allows modulation of nearly every parameter in Sines</li>\r\n\t<li>Arpeggiator with tempo sync</li>\r\n\t<li>Four fully modulatable effects sections: multiple distortion and sample-crushing options; mod FX with phaser, chorus, flanger, or rotary speaker; delay with stereo, ping-pong, or tape delay modes; five reverb effects, including Cherry Audio's acclaimed \"Galactic\" algorithm</li>\r\n\t<li>Drift controls that optionally apply variation to oscillators and filter frequencies to add authentic analogue character</li>\r\n\t<li>Eight-band graphic EQ</li>\r\n\t<li>Channel pressure and polyphonic aftertouch as a polyphonic modulation source</li>\r\n\t<li>Support for MIDI Polyphonic Expression (MPE) -- Pitch, Channel Pressure, and Timbre -- making Sines capable of more organic and expressive performances when using MPE-compatible controllers</li>\r\n\t<li>Cherry Audio's popular Focus zoom-in feature, as well as standard UI zoom and resize with drag</li>\r\n\t<li>Over 700 presets created by a talented and diverse group of sound design veterans</li>\r\n\t<li>Complete MIDI control and DAW automation for all controls, with easy-to-use MIDI learn</li>\r\n\t<li>Preset and Global level MIDI mapping</li>\r\n\t<li>Highly optimised coding for optimal performance with ultra-low CPU load</li>\r\n\t<li>User-adjustable oversampling control</li>\r\n\t<li>Available in AU, VST, VST3, AAX, and standalone formats</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>System Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mac</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>10.13 or above.</li>\r\n\t<li>macOS 13 Ventura supported.</li>\r\n\t<li>64-bit required.</li>\r\n\t<li>Native Apple M1 processor support, including Apple M1 Ultra.</li>\r\n\t<li>3.4 GHz Quad-Core or M1 CPU with 8GB of RAM recommended.</li>\r\n\t<li>Available in AU, VST, VST3, AAX &amp; Standalone formats</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Windows</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Windows 7 or above (including Windows 11), 64-bit required.</li>\r\n\t<li>Quad-core computer with 8GB of RAM recommended.</li>\r\n\t<li>Available in VST, VST3, AAX &amp; Standalone formats</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>"}

Now you can. SONiVOX’s Solina Redux virtual instrument adds a sweet sounding virtual analogue synthesizer to a classic reproduction of an Arp Solina String Ensemble, then throws in TWO fully programmable 8-step sequencers to boot. It’s a match made in heaven and one that produces sonic textures you simply can’t get any other way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Arp Solina was the preeminent string ensemble in the 1970’s, made famous by the Eagles, Elton John, Pink Floyd, The Cure, Joy Division, Tangerine Dream, New Order and many others. Its analogue Violin, Viola, Cello, Contra Bass, Trumpet and Horn sounds have a sound that creates rich retro sounding orchestral ensembles, especially with its famous “Ensemble” chorus effect. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Solina Redux gives you access to the original Solina sounds, including a model of the Ensemble chorus effect, but includes a modern virtual analogue synthesizer as a sidecar. The combination of these two synthesizers provides a sound palette that is both retro and modern or anything in between at your discretion. Each synth includes a multi-mode filter, amplitude and filter envelopes, LFO modulations and send effects. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>To top it off, Solina Redux adds in two fully programmable step sequencers, one for the Solina instrument and one for the analogue synthesizer. Play one note and out comes a modern orchestra unlike any you’ve heard. Each step sequencer gives you per step control over the pitch of each note, the volume of each note, the filter cutoff of each note, and the panning of each note. Other controls include gate time, tempo sync, time division, swing, note order and octave shift. </p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A two-in-one Arp Solina and Virtual Analog Synthesizer</li>\r\n\t<li>Both synths hot-rodded to include multi-mode filters (low-pass, high-pass, bandpass, notch, peak) with individual LFO and envelope control</li>\r\n\t<li>Three modelled effects including the Solina “Ensemble” effect, phaser, and vibrato.</li>\r\n\t<li>Two fully programmable step sequencers including step control over filters and panning</li>\r\n\t<li>Supports all popular plugin formats and operates as a standalone PC/Mac app for live performance. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>System Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A virtual instrument in VST, AU, AAX and Standalone formats for Mac and Windows.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mac</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>OS X 10.10 - macOS 11.1 Big Sur <strong>(Intel-based only) (64-bit only)</strong>\n</li>\r\n\t<li>4 GB RAM (8 GB or more recommended)</li>\r\n\t<li>2 GB free disc space</li>\r\n\t<li>Intel Core i5, i7, 2.3GHz processor or higher</li>\r\n\t<li>Core Audio drive</li>\r\n\t<li>Internet Access (Download and Authorization)</li>\r\n\t<li>A FREE <a href=\"http://ilok.com\" target=\"_blank\">iLok account &amp; manager</a> is required for authorisation of this software - no iLok USB key is required</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Windows</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Windows 8 / 8.1 / 10 <strong>(64-bit only)</strong>\n</li>\r\n\t<li>4 GB RAM (8GB or more recommended)</li>\r\n\t<li>2 GB free disc space</li>\r\n\t<li>Intel Core i5, i7, 2.3GHz processor or higher</li>\r\n\t<li>ASIO sound driver</li>\r\n\t<li>Internet Access (Download and Authorization)</li>\r\n\t<li>A FREE <a href=\"http://ilok.com\" target=\"_blank\">iLok account &amp; manager</a> is required for authorisation of this software - no iLok USB key is required</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>"}

Arturia modelled both the Fender Rhodes Suitcase Piano and Stage Piano—including separate 1973 and 1974 models of the Stage in order to capture the difference in their components. A total sonic and aesthetic fidelity to the originals. You can even easily pop the top and customize the various mechanical components to make your instrument unique. Classic amps and an array of effect pedals round out the virtual electric piano you’ve always dreamed of having.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/5020/content_stage73v-2-pluginboutique.jpg\" style=\"height:338px; width:800px\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align:center\">A Sound that’s Always in Style</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you’re playing yesterday’s hits or making tomorrow’s, the sound of the Stage-73 is a true player in its own right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The venerable sound of the Fender Rhodes simply refuses to go out of style. These instruments were used by a who’s who of keyboardists who pioneered mid-century jazz, funk, R&amp;B and rock. With a tonal range spanning smooth bell-like qualities to an aggressive bark depending upon how hard they’re played, these seminal keyboards have been in continual use across just about every style imaginable right through to today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Stage-73 V brings you all the signature sounds that propelled the instruments and their players into the spotlight and onto the charts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/5021/content_stage73v-3-pluginboutique.jpg\" style=\"height:264px; width:800px\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align:center\">Just Like Playing the Real Thing</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>There’s nothing quite like playing a Rhodes… except playing the Stage-73 V.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There have been a lot of attempts to emulate the Fender Rhodes. You already know that most software, and even hardware, based on samples falls well short of the mark. That’s what inspired us to instead apply Arturia's critically acclaimed modelled technology to the whole system—including the tines (metal tone rods), the hammers that strike them, the pickups that generate the electromagnetic current, and the circuits that amplify it all. The sum total is a totally authentic homage that stands on its own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stage-73 V isn’t just one instrument - it’s many. It encapsulates a range of Rhodes piano models, from Stage to Suitcase, ‘73 or ‘74, Classic to Modern, putting a huge range of hearty sounds at your disposal - luscious vibrato and all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you’ve played the Stage-73 V, you won’t settle for anything less.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/5022/content_stage73v-4-pluginboutique.jpg\" style=\"height:338px; width:800px\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align:center\">Unprecedented Intimate Control</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The Stage-73 V gives you access to the controls of the original instruments—plus many adjustments you’ve never been able to get your hands on before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To capture that authentic Rhodes magic, we had to dive deep. Stage-73 V2’s physical modelling sound engine offers an electric piano experience that’s so realistic, you’ll forget you’re playing a software instrument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you just want to rock the designer presets or get busy with mods of your own, the Stage-73 V has the flexibility to be just about any electric piano you want it to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Warmth, Crunch, and Colour</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stage-73 V is designed as a tailor-made Rhodes toolkit. With a newly-integrated pedal rig, you can add emulated stompboxes to your chain, from red-hot distortion to glorious tape echo. Assemble your own fully-customizable keyboard rig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Amp it Up</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You’ve chosen your electric piano model. You’ve chosen your stompboxes. What better way to round it off than with a cranked amp? Choose from the sparkling valve response of the Twin Amp, or the lush stereo revolutions of the Rotary Speaker - complete with amp controls and custom room settings. Give your electric piano the rock ‘n’ roll edge it deserves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ahead of the Curve</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Go beyond emulation; Stage-73 V is yours to customize. Open up the Advanced Panel, and you’ll find an array of enhancements that put you firmly in charge of every aspect of your sound:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Choose your hammer hardness, from soft felt to sharp metallic strikes. </li>\r\n\t<li>Incorporate realistic ambient noise, from pickup hum to tine overtones.</li>\r\n\t<li>Draw your own velocity curve for a custom playing response from your keyboard.</li>\r\n\t<li>Tweak the pickup settings to drastically affect the instrument’s electric character.</li>\r\n\t<li>Easily adjust the dynamics and tone bar resonance and find your acoustic preference.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/24510/content_stage_73_breakdown_pluginboutique.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 328px;\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>What Else?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TAE® Powered</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>TAE® \"True Analog Emulation\" is Arturia's exclusive technology that accurately reproduces the defining sonic qualities of analogue synthesizers.

The trick is finding that inspiration in the first place, and it also helps a lot if you have an easy way to transport your ideas from inside your head to a flawless recording that you can share with the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Statement Lead</strong> is a state-of-the-art, user-friendly synth designed with the contemporary producer and songwriter in mind. With carefully recorded and processed sound sources from  rare and expensive synths and built-in effects of the highest quality, and modules for the endlessly expandable Eurorack modular synth Modular, Statement inspires you to make a statement. This is the lead synth you need to create hit songs that sound polished and finished with no complications along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Designed by Experts, Built on Legacy</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Softube has a long history of modelling professional gear. After nearly two decades working in collaboration with premium pro audio brands like Tube-Tech, Solid State Logic, Chandler Limited®, Weiss Engineering, Trident, and more, Softube have a solid track record recreating indisputable classics in software form that sound precisely like their hardware counterparts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This includes expertise in mixing and mastering tools and synthesizer plug-ins like Modular, Softube's Eurorack platform, that was developed in close collaboration with Doepfer and includes modules from Buchla, Mutable Instruments, Intellijel, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Statement is built on this legacy, and Softube took the same meticulous approach they always do – everything needs to be exact, with skillful recording, precise testing, and fine-tuning for the best sound quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>High-Quality Effects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Statement comes with built-in effects that give you precise control over your sound. Sculpt your lead parts exactly how you want them with Drive, Reverb, Delay, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rare, Legendary Sounds</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Build up your own unique sounds with a mix of one or two of the 90 waveforms recorded from a variety of rare, expensive hardware synths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Perfect Songwriting Tool</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The carefully designed presets make it easy to get started, and the intuitive interface speeds up the process of going from idea to finished song.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Use it in Modular</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Statement Lead includes Source, Filter, and FX modules for Softube Modular so you can build your own version or create a hybrid monster synth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Unique Sound Sources and Cool Filter/Sequencer Options</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sound sources include 90 waveforms in 11 different categories. Each sound is built up by a mix of one or two of these waveforms. You can also opt to add a dirt layer of looped material such as TV Screen, Taped Storm, and Robotic Noise or transient material such as Plastic Attack and Metal Attack from the Analog Dirt section to add some grit for a richer or dirtier sound. The dirt can be mixed with the other sound sources and sent to the filter or sent dry to the output section.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The filter section with built-in modulation sequencer consists of an analogue-sounding low-pass filter with three slope types, 6, 12, and 24 dB/octave. You can adjust cutoff frequency, feedback, envelope type and timing, and how much the envelope will affect the cutoff frequency. The sequencer is always running with its tempo synchronized to the DAW clock, so you’ll always get a rhythmic change in time with your music. The loop length of the sequencer can be set from 1 (no loop) to 16 (all of the available 16 steps), and these steps can be set to levels or as distinctive on/off triggers to affect filter cutoff or output volume, either stepped or slewed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A Few Powerful Tone Controls, All Kinds of Creative Possibilities</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shape your sound further in the Tone section, where you can mix your sound sources and choose whether you prefer an overall sharp attack or a slow fade-out for your sound. Punch sets the overall amplitude envelope of the sound, from a slow buildup to something snappier and punchier. With Auto Glide, you can start or end each note with an automatic pitch-bend up or down with a programmable time and range that can go from minus two octaves to plus two octaves. You can select how you want to trigger it, for example if velocity is above a certain threshold, if aftertouch reaches a certain level, or every time a note is played or released. This is very useful for creating organic analogue sounds. Aging sets the amount of unpredictability – if you turn this up, you get less stable pitch and more unpredictable attacks, dirt and grit, and analogue goodness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sculpt Your Sound with High-Quality Effects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Statement comes loaded with effects make it easy to fine tune, create spaces, add clarity, and further sculpt your lead sounds. These include Drive, Reverb, Delay, Multiband Compression, and Spatialization. The Delay and Reverb are very sophisticated and adapted for synthesizer sounds featuring Synced pre delay and ducking on the Reverb, 8 individual L &amp; R taps, and ducking on the delay. The Multiband Compressor is a smart one-knob solution, and the control set has been thoroughly tweaked to give you as much control as possible with as few knobs as possible. These effects have been thoughtfully selected and specifically designed for polyphonic synthesizer-lead sounds with the same superb quality as Softube mixing plug-ins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A Modern Instrument Designed by the Best</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The extensive source material for Statement Lead came from carefully recording and processing the sounds of rare, well-known, expensive hardware synthesizers to produce 90 different waveforms in 11 different categories to serve as sound sources. To accomplish this, Softube worked with sound designer and rare synth collector Tobias Menguser, who also partnered with us to create Softube's synth for bass sounds, Monoment Bass. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inspiring presets to get you started For a producer in the EDM, drum and bass, and house genres, it’s essential to have presets you can browse through to achieve a polished sound in seconds. This is so much easier than working with the complicated parameters of an analogue synth. Statement comes loaded with carefully created presets. There are no fillers—they're all good and the perfect starting point to find the type of sound you hear in your head. After you find it, you can dig deeper and start tweaking until it’s exactly the sound you need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Statement Lead &amp; Monoment Bass: Synth Siblings</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Softube’s bass synth Monoment Bass has the same kind of user interface and many of the same features as Statement. They were designed to work perfectly together to write and produce hit songs in the EDM, drum and bass, and house genres. Use Monoment for bass sounds and Statement for lead sounds and you have the entire range covered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two synths feature quite different waveforms and slightly different effects with the same intuitive design and phenomenal sound quality. If you use Monoment already, Statement is the perfect addition for you, and you’ll feel right at home when using it. If you don’t and you’re ready to create complex sounds with an analogue feeling, they’re the perfect pair to meet all of your songwriting needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Modular Modules</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Statement Source</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Statement Source is the source engine from Statement Lead as a stand-alone module. It has a built-in amplitude envelope, waveform mixing, dirt level, and aging. It can be played polyphonically within modular over midi and/or monophonically at the same time via the gate and note jacks. The dirt level, punch, release, and aging parameters have CV control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21262/content_modules-statement-source.jpeg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 300px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Statement Filter</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Statement Filter is the filter section from Statement Lead as a stand-alone module. It has a built-in filter envelope and sequencer. The envelope is triggered through the external gate jack. All of the sequencer functions, which include slew, range, amount, and swing, have external CV control. The sequencer is automatically locked to the DAW tempo at all times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/21263/content_modules-statement-filter.jpeg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 300px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Statement FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Statement FX is the effects engine from Statement Lead as a stand-alone module.

However, due to plug-in host differences between DAWs—and our rigorous standards—Softube only officially test their plug-ins and instruments in the most recent versions of Pro Tools, Logic Pro, Cubase, Ableton Live, Studio One, and Reaper. Softube plug-ins are not tested regularly in non-listed systems. They will likely work if the system requirements are met. However, the manufacturer cannot guarantee a solution for issues in unsupported systems. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nSoftube strongly recommend using VST3, as some of their plug-ins have features that are not present in the older VST format. Supported sample rates: 44.1, 48, 88.2, 96, 176.4, and 192 kHz, in both mono and stereo. The most recent maintenance release of your DAW application is recommended. AAX DSP is not currently in active development. TDM/VENUE/RTAS are no longer supported. See Legacy Installers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Important Note: </strong>Make sure that you always use the latest iLok License Manager.

Precise control of coupling and interactions at the bridge breath life into your tone with beating and organic envelopes.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Pickups - </strong>Whether they are single coils or humbuckers, pickups are a fundamental part of the electric guitar sound. They shape the whole instrument’s response and their multiple configurations give tremendous tone flexibility.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Body Shopping - </strong>The soundboard of a guitar radiates vibrations from the strings. Choose a body size to colour the sound with specific resonances and find the right character.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Mutes and Scratches - </strong>As on a real guitar, strings interact with the player's hands and frets. Fine tune your rhythm parts and riffs with palm muting, scratches, and hammer-ons.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bare Naked - All Suited Up</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You’ll love the pure raw sound of Strum GS-2, but the built-in effects will bring it to so many places that you’ll enjoy having them on hand.

Patches were inspired by legendary synths from Roland, Sequential Circuits, and others. But Super 8 has a character all its own. Modern presets give you combinations of oscillators, filters, and modulation settings that wouldn’t have been possible on original hardware.</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Built to be Played</strong>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Explore the full range of Super 8’s creative possibilities with your MIDI controller. Drive the Super 8 pitch wheel, mod wheel, and touch strip controls from your hardware to produce expressive leads, shifting soundscapes, and evolving textures. You can set parameters directly from the interface’s front page – or take advantage of automatic parameter mapping using a KOMPLETE KONTROL keyboard.

Its unique combination of additive synthesis and frequency modulation delivered a creative edge to the privileged few keyboardists, producers, film composers and sound designers who could afford systems that ranged from $13k to $400k.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of those rock-solid systems are still in use today. Arturia has recreated this highly revered hit maker in partnership with original programmer Cameron Jones, delivering the immense rich textures and creative palette of this vintage instrument, while dramatically improving it to let you blaze new musical trails today with sounds never heard before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/4997/content_synclavier-productpage-1.jpg\" style=\"height:256px; width:800px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Sounds You Will Only Find Here</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There’s simply nothing else like the powerhouse sound of the Synclavier V. No synth arsenal is complete without it.<br>\r\nThere’s no hint of analog or samples here—this is the sound of unabashed digital synthesis in all its glory. While it can certainly create unique mellow tones, this vintage flagship is more known for its distinctive digital character ranging from edgy to eardrum-ripping brash to intergalactic. It’s especially ideal for extended pads and slow cinematic, ambient soundscapes. Plus, we’ve invested in significant updates that make the Synclavier V a thoroughly modern instrument with sounds that set it—and you—completely apart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hundreds of presets from the world’s top sound designers tame the unparalleled power of the Synclavier V and place it at all your fingertips for instant inspiration and easy customization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/4998/content_synclavier-productpage-2-pluginboutique.jpg\" style=\"height:338px; width:800px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>A Programmer’s Dream</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While you’ll get tons of love from Synclavier V’s presets alone, there’s a universe of sonic adventures waiting just beneath the surface whenever you’re ready.<br>\r\nThe unique sound of the Synclavier V comes from its blend of additive and FM synthesis, with control over 24 additive harmonics on both the carrier and modulation oscillators. Where the original instrument let you mix four uniquely programmed Partials Timbres in a Timbre preset, Arturia’s recreation has twelve, boosting your creative possibilities exponentially. The Time Slice engine allows complex evolutions of the sound over time—even several minutes if you want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Programming the Synclavier V is a study in elegance.

With advanced filter parameters like input gain, drive and acid, you can get that \"analog\" sound from the filters!</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>VAnalog Filters</strong> - The 'VAnalog' filters are modelled after the famous ladder filter, so they self oscillate when the filter resonance is maxed out. They have a continuously variable slope, which is unique to SynthMaster. They have 3 different CPU settings: \"Basic\", \"Normal\" and \"High\". The Basic setting sounds similar to the other algorithms in most cases and consumes at least 50% less CPU.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Multimode Filters </strong>- With the new 'multimode' filter type, it is possible to switch from Lowpass to Bandpass to Highpass filter types continuously. For analog multimode filters, it is also possible to change the slope of the filter continuously from 0 dB/oct to 24 dB/oct.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Dual Filters</strong> - With the new 'dual' filter type, two multimode filters can be run simultaneously, either in parallel or in series. The mix ratios between the filters and the topology (parallel/series) between them can be changed continuously, as well as the modes and cutoff frequencies of the filters.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Comb Filters</strong> - Comb filters are digital filters used in physical modeling synthesis.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://static.synthmaster.com/sm_images/filter1.jpg\" style=\"height: 466px; width: 350px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Effects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rich set of Effects: SynthMaster features 11 different effect types: Distortion, LoFi, Ensemble, Phaser, 6 Band EQ, Compressor, Vocoder, Delay, Chorus, Tremolo, Reverb.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>11 types of effects</strong> - Distortion, LoFi, Ensemble, Phaser, 6 Band EQ, Compressor, Vocoder, Delay, Chorus, Tremolo, Reverb.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Flexible Effects Routing</strong> - Each of the 11 effect types can be inserted on any layer insert or on any of the 2 global effect bus inserts.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Before/Inside/After Filter Distortion</strong> - A distortion stage can be inserted before, after, or even inside the filters. For analog filters, the distortion is applied for each of the 4 filter stages in 'inside' mode.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Other features</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Powerful Arpeggiator</strong> - The arpeggiator in SynthMaster features classic arpeggiator modes such as Up, Down, UpDown, DownUp, UpDown2, DownUp2, AsPlayed as well as Sequence, Chord and Arpeggiate modes. Each of the 32 steps of the arpeggiator has its own Velocity, Note Number, Note Length, Slide and Hold parameters.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Easy Parameters - </strong>SynthMaster features 8 easy knobs and 2 XY pads that can be freely assigned as modulation sources so that the complexity of the synth engine could be hidden away and only the most important parameters of a preset can be controlled by the user.

They have a continuously variable slope, which is unique to SynthMaster. They have 3 different CPU settings: \"Basic\", \"Normal\" and \"High\". The Basic setting sounds similar to the other algorithms in most cases and consumes at least 50% less CPU.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Multimode Filters </strong>- With the new 'multimode' filter type, it is possible to switch from Lowpass to Bandpass to Highpass filter types continuously. For analog multimode filters, it is also possible to change the slope of the filter continuously from 0 dB/oct to 24 dB/oct.</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>Dual Filters</strong> - With the new 'dual' filter type, two multimode filters can be run simultaneously, either in parallel or in series.

Look no further than Synthi V.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Synthi V brings you all the experimental excitement of EMS’ legendary 3-oscillator analog synths—now infused with thoroughly modern enhancements. Venture beyond unusual lead and bass sounds to create soundscapes and sci-fi effects ranging from beautiful to bizarre and everything in between.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Synthi V will bring out the synth wizard in you.

Where most competitive designs like the Minimoog sacrificed flexibility to size and simplicity, EMS retained a modular heart through the genius of one of the first matrix patchbays to grace a synth. That additional versatility led to more experimentation outside of melodic norms and into the more electronic realms of psychedelia and sci-fi effects. Cue Pink Floyd’s “On the Run” from “The Dark Side of the Moon” LP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Synthi V is the perfect evolution of the synth that turned a lot of heads. Now you can use it to turn some heads of your own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/14891/content_02.jpg\" style=\"height:408px; width:800px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Re-Make/Re-Model</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you're one of the lucky ones who owns or has played a Synthi or VCS3, you'll not only be amazed at how accurate our model is, but also blown away by its dramatic enhancements and new features. If you've never had the joy of experiencing the original, you're in for a treat with Synthi V.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like the original, Synthi V is one fat, edgy beast that begs experimentation. In addition to making minor mods, we’ve added a whole new set of digital tools that bring this instrument to the vanguard of today’s music. A modern step sequencer, dedicated beat-syncable LFO, and on-board effects are just some of the sonic goodies that will make Synthi V your new obsession. You also now have the power of full matrix modulation targeting every single parameter with totally variable signal strength. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, yeah… did we mention that we’ve turned this awesome monophonic synth into a 4-voice poly? You’re welcome!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Synthi V, you can add spice to any genre—or create your own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/14893/content_03_2.jpg\" style=\"height:403px; width:500px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>With infinite sonic possibilities, it’s still easy to find just the right sound</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Synthi V’s comes with an extensive library of leads, basses, textures, sound effects and more.

Tops Charts.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The Riser is an all-new instrument for designing musical transitions of epic proportions. A powerful, synth-based instrument, The Riser features all of the tools you need to compose heart-stopping transitions in one intuitive user-interface. In seconds, you can construct rises, falls, swells, fades, and more, based on our coveted sound synthesis technology. For instant inspiration, The Riser includes 300 pro-grade presets that you can edit, deconstruct, copy, mangle, and implement into your tracks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transitions add suspense, hype, drama, and movement to your music. Cymbal swells and reversed instruments were go-to transitions for years, until the DAW pioneered fast and flexible audio editing, paving the way for complex sound effects. When combined with synths and other audio shaping tools, transitions completed their metamorphosis from science to art. Until now, this process has convoluted and time-intensive, taking attention away from the overall project itself. The composer spent more time trying to get plugins, virtual sample players, hardware effects, sound modules, and other gear to play nice with each other – and that was before hitting “record”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A 3-for-All</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Featuring the most powerful and musical virtual synthesis available, The Riser can be used to create classic transitions or effects never-before-heard by human ears. The core of The Riser’s mojo are three continuously variable oscillators; sweep, noise and chord. Each oscillator features a dedicated Filter send and graphical parameter depiction. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sweep – featuring volume, frequency and oscillator shape – dictates the direction and progression of the transition. Create rises, falls, stops, and swells with audible and visible feedback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Providing volume, shape, and pitch controls, the Noise oscillator infuses texture into your transition. Start shaping to add grit, bite, hiss, punch, and more to the effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Riser’s Chord oscillator introduces you to an uncharted creative continent. Use it to match The Riser’s sonic structure to your song’s key (or a contrasting one) and blend it to taste; it can be as musical as you want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three Low Frequency Oscillators (LFOs) provide additional modulation to your transition. A tempo-sync’d LFO works in harmony with the native song tempo in your DAW to increase the transition’s complexity. The second LFO is free-running, meaning it has not ties to the native tempo. Third, the Pumper effect modulates the synthesis with dynamics control in tandem with track tempo. This pulsating effect adds punch and movement to the transition, and features various time divisions and depth controls for adapting to or accentuating your track.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those looking for turn-key transitions, our team of sound designers have constructed 300 fully editable presets across various types, bringing modern, useable transitions to your project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wide Compatibility</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Riser offers unequalled flexibility with your current production/composition setup. Available for Mac or PC and in AU, VST and AAX formats, it can operate as an instrument in nearly any DAW such as Logic Pro X, Cubase, Ableton Live, Pro Tools, Sonar, Digital Performer, Reaper and more. It does not require specialty sample players or proprietary software in order to be used in your DAW project – simply call it up when you need it, and use it. Further, you can map your favorite keyboard or controller to the virtual knobs and faders within your The Riser or most DAWs, offering seamless operation with your composition style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Get Effected</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We put the essential effects for transition design into The Riser, for fast access to studio-grade audio manipulation heaven. A tempo-sync’d delay with time-division can slap or drench your transition with the subtlety of a feather – or sledgehammer. To add space to your patch, mix in one of 4 reverb types, all of which are completely adjustable to complement your track. To really grab the listener, we incorporated Panning and Width controls, letting you master stereo positioning and intimacy. The Filter section features over 20 types, ranging from low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, multi-pole/pass combos, band reject, and phase shift. When used in concert with The Riser’s LFOs and variable oscillators, you get standout results with signature flair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Invert Your Thinking</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experimentation is the key to inspiration, and The Riser gives you a few additional tricks to unlock new sounds. A randomizer will randomly select values for the main parameters to give you that create spark. The Invert mode will reverse the transition, letting you hear it with the direction switched. Rises become falls, swells become fades, and more.

This virtual instrument is using a new innovative ”Audio Model” format with a unique capability to process very large volumes of waves, extracted from real audio. Whether you want to play around with the included Audio Model Starter Pack (instruments &amp; voices) and presets, or import your own audio to shape your own unique soundscapes – it is fair to say that you are in for a creative journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>There Are Already Lots Of Synths And Samplers Around, So Why This?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simply put, Tomofon is not a sampler. It is a musical instrument in its own right and doesn’t necessarily aim to imitate real instruments or voices. Tomofon introduces a new \"Audio Model” format where the generated sounds are seamlessly morphed between different layers and sections of a massive amount of real audio waves. This gives an instantly playable synthesizer that can sound very organic, but also like something out of this world. The possibilities of changing the character of the sounds are so vast and multi-layered that it will add a new extra dimension to your music production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How Does It Work?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tomofon converts audio files into a large set of oscillating waves, which are then mapped into pitch zones where each wave represents one layer (a bit similar to how a sampler structures different velocity zones). The main difference is that since each zone is populated with waves instead of ordinary samples, the synth engine can morph between them (both layers and zones). This makes all transitions between zones and layers continuous and seamless. The structure containing these organized wavetables is called an Audio Model and gives Tomofon its dynamic properties and characteristic sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Create And Share Your Own Unique Sounds</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A significant feature of this plug-in is that users can import their own audio files and create new and unique Audio Models. Ordinary audio files (preferably with monophonic content) can easily be imported and distributed into different pitch zones over the keyboard range, either automatically or manually. Doing an automatic import is basically a one-click process that instantly results in a proper playable Audio Model. A manual import gives the user full control of which waves should end up in which pitch zone. Last but not least you can easily share your own created Audio Models with others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/33097/original_Tomofon_UI_depth.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 273px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Included In Tomofon v1.2</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tomofon comes pre-loaded with a pack of 124 Audio Models. Included with your download is also over 180 presets to choose from, to get you going right away. From there on you can venture further and experiment with the existing Audio Models, or start using the built-in editor of the plug-in, importing your own sounds to shape and deconstruct. More instruments (Audio Model Packs and presets) will be added by Klevgrand in the future. Now compatible with MPE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep your eyes open for upcoming releases – the Tomofonia has just begun!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The synth engine is packed with features that emphasizes the musical and audible possibilities of how to play back an Audio Model.

{"title": "Twist", "brand": "SONiVOX", "url": "/product/1-Instruments/4-Synth/1849-Twist", "rating": 4.0, "description": "<div itemprop=\"description\"><p><strong>Serious Sound Design</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wrap yourself around Twist 2—the Spectral Morphing Synthesis instrument from SONiVOX. Combining a dynamic interface, an advanced pattern generator, and onboard effects, Twist 2 is your toolkit for serious sound design using simple, time-saving controls. Two swirling sound layers provide unique harmonic controls, forming the foundation for every patch. Common elements include a monstrous multi-mode filter, independent Amp and Filter envelope generators, plus a remarkable LFO that can be sync’d to the current tempo. The onscreen interface is clean and uncluttered; the well-defined controls deliver incredible sound-sculpting abilities, while providing immediate audio results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Turn and Learn</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the onscreen controls, Twist 2 features a brilliant MIDI Learn Mode. Simply adjusting a parameter and then touching an external MIDI control creates a link between the two. This intuitive MIDI mapping system allows Twist 2 to quickly integrate with your favorite MIDI hardware controller. In fact, Twist 2 can save and recall your MIDI Learn presets and use them with any patch, so you only need to create them once.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Patterns of Success</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Twist 2 pattern generator begins as a familiar step-sequencer, and rapidly escalates into an unbelievable tool for sonic creation. In addition to pitch and velocity, the pattern generator provides additional tabs for adding precise measured-step control of crucial sound creation parameters. Portamento can be selected for each step, as can the filter frequency. LFO depth, rate, and sync can be defined per step. The harmonic width and content for each layer can also be specified. By automating even just one or two of these parameters, the pattern generator can infuse your sound with awe-inspiring depth and motion. Pattern presets can also be saved, recalled, and quickly modified on demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Move to the Music</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Onboard pro-grade chorus and reverb effects breathe new life into your sounds. In addition, the stereo delay allows either the Left or Right channel—or both—to be synchronized to beat values of the current tempo, tying your sound, song, and effects together. And speaking of tempo, Twist 2 uses the SONiVOX Intelligent Rhythm Control (IRC) to keep your playing in the pocket. Combining the IRC Resolution and IRC Gate adjusts incoming MIDI note data so your playing is accurately in-time, in real-time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Finders, Keepers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twist 2 features an integrated patch browser that makes it easy to store, sort, and find exactly the sound you are looking for. Patch attributes such as Genre, Color, Character—and of course, Name—allow your sounds to be stored in a musically meaningful way, as opposed to just indexed as numbers. Any and all attributes can be removed or re-assigned as your sound collection grows. Best of all, Twist 2 comes with hundreds of professionally programmed sounds to get you started. Each one can be endlessly tweaked and modified to rapidly build your customized Twist 2 sound collection.

Some of the strings and piano sounds will bring back fond memories, while there's plenty of depth and power to the basses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sound and functionality have been designed together with musicians to cover a wide range of sounds and ease of use. We took a close look at some old techniques to reinvent them for the current age. The user interface is simple but powerful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And it's a pretty versatile instrument. Once you’ve built your sound, there’s tons of sound polish in a juicy filter section and two chained multi-effect units.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Those Wicked Formant Filters!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/8599/content_block2-image_pluginboutique.jpg\" style=\"height: 400px; width: 600px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Activate Vowel Mode</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sound of Unique springs to life when it hits the filter section. Needless to say, analogue high-pass, low-pass and band-pass varieties are in place, along with a comb filter. But standards aside, the actual intention behind this project, a Vowel Filter, also became its outstanding feature. The Vowel Filter allows you to string together two or four vowel formants and play them back in a multitude of ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The internal controller section will bring in some much-needed dynamics. There's a recordable XY field, a sequencer and it's all very easy to manage with just a right-click on any control. User feedback range from \"the Controllers section rocks!\" to \"the Controllers section just blows me away!\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Earns the Right to Carry its Name</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/8600/content_block3-image_pluginboutique.jpg\" style=\"height: 400px; width: 600px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>It's not a Software, it's a Mindset!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to the unusual architecture, Unique always remained special down to the present day. The duo-phonic arpeggiator, polyphonic auto-panning per oscillator and the complex filter have what it takes to let your mix shine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The modulators can be triggered in many different and “unique” ways: for example with the lowest note played, the first note played or even with the sequencer clock or the arpeggiator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet another stunning feature: The internal LFOs have fade algorithms for rate and intensity; and we implemented a proper polyphonic portamento, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Update to Version 1.5</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/10580/content_block4_pluginboutique.jpg\" style=\"height: 400px; width: 600px;\"></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Free for Users: new GUI and NKS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The update sets new accents in visual language, concept and user experience. With its minimal flat design, version 1.5 departs from the somewhat stale skeuomorphism and pays homage to the classics of German industrial design. Adjust any control and the new GUI will come up with the respective values and scales! We find the new design very apropos and like working with it. Chapeau &amp; Thanks to Max Mondon Design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Native’s Kontrol Standard (NKS) is quickly spreading in the industry and we also think that it’s a good move towards integration for all the friends of NI’s great tools out there. We added NKS support to Unique, providing perfect integration with Maschine and Komplete Kontrol (-&gt;NKS).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sounds &amp; Presets</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Passion, Soul and Sex...</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Unique comes with more than 300 presets, that show off its insane power and provide some good starting points for your next hook-line</li>\r\n\t<li>They are sorted into categories like Bass, Pads, Leads, etc., but there's also one folder called \"Erotique\"</li>\r\n\t<li>Version 1.5.1 comes with 40 fresh sounds from Christian C.

The most versatile and best-sounding synth you may ever encounter. There's nothing VPS Avenger can't do, offering tons of features and a gigantic ever-expanding library from some of the best sound designers around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>8 OSC modules capable of many different forms of synthesis</li>\r\n\t<li>Over 1000 factory presets</li>\r\n\t<li>Powerful drag and drop modulation matrix</li>\r\n\t<li>Advanced arpeggiator and sequencing capabilities</li>\r\n\t<li>Intuitive Routing System</li>\r\n\t<li>Loaded with over 30 effects</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Full Spectrum of Synthesis</h4>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34071/original_Group_1.png\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With up to 8 OSC modules in total, VPS Avenger features many different forms of synthesis, from Classic VA Synthesis with saw, square, sine, triangle and noise oscillators, to Wavetable Synthesis with wavetables that can be morphed and edited seamlessly, to real FM synthesis where you can modulate to countless FM shapes, including your own custom designs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" id=\"youtube_player\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fhZ401fX4kA\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choose your own oscillator shapes by importing and converting ANY 1-cycle waveform sample into an oscillator shape, or choose from thousands of hand-selected shapes in VPS Avenger's Factory Library, including emulations of the shapes of classic gear, complex digital shapes, dubstep screams, real instruments and much more. You can even freely draw your own oscillator shapes - use a pencil or draw lines, use smoothening parameters or normalize, and fade in/outs to help create every shape imaginable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of VPS Avenger's 8 oscillators can also be a Multisample player. With the new 'Sample Stacker' feature, you can layer up to 4 multi-samples in each OSC module with 1 click. VPS Avenger comes with a huge library of more than 1000 Multi-Samples, ranging from Pianos &amp; Organs, Synths, Real Instruments, Voices and much more. There are also 2x special Sample Sources: Attack Clicks and Organic Noises, which make for great layering additions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each oscillator can also have its own V-Saw (Supersaw) with 1-7 voices over 1-4 octaves &amp; pan spread, vibrato LFO, chorder, additional Sub-OSC model and synthesis model.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34075/original_Osc.png\"></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With every oscillator capable of working as a full granular module, you can even explore the world of granular synthesis. Load one of the many granular samples from the factory sounds into it, or drag and drop your own samples to explore the sample being played back in hundreds of small grains. Pitch, spread, reverse these grains, and play forward, backward or at whatever speed or direction you want by using the internal powerful granular envelope. In Resample mode, you can also cycle through long wave files and explore microscopic grains as an oscillator source. The Wavetable Envelope / Editor is a specialized envelope for all wavetables that includes fade ins / outs, zoom, normalize, and reverse features, as well as a 'Wobble' pattern generator which lets you multiply, reverse or flip the envelope with a pattern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Highly flexible and complex but easy to handle - VPS Avenger offers unlimited possibilities for synthesis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Loaded with Content</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>VPS Avenger comes packed with over 1000 factory presets, 620 multi-samples, 218 special samples (attacks &amp; noises), 154 resampler waves, 168 drumkits, 168 drum sequences, 596 wavetables, 219 granular samples and thousands of oscillator shapes to get started with.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34076/original_Browser.png\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Amp &amp; Filter Modules</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For further sound sculpting, VPS Avenger offers 4 amp modules and 4 filter modules that any of the oscillators can be routed to, with each offering their own analogue AHDSR envelopes. They can also be triggered from other envelope sources, such as the modulation envelope. The filter modules offer 47 different filter types and a drive control - these include all basic filter types as well as an analogue filter, comb filter, talking/vowel filters, peak filters, FM/crush filters, TB filters &amp; more. The amp module also features a spike parameter, volume/panning/key tracking, and a stereo spread parameter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Quick &amp; Complex Melodies</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With up to 8 arp modules, you can build your own complex melodies of 4 x 32 notes using the 4 sub patterns and up / down / random / poly modes.

The envelopes each act as free configurable envelopes where you can add as many points as you like to shape the sound. You can sync the envelope for synchronised time-based effects to create moving and unique patterns, or use one of the many trigger modes, such as first/last notes, arpeggio, or the kick drum from the drum sequencer, to name a few.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>VPS Avenger includes a perfectly synced step sequencer that includes contour, decay, gate time, editable step lengths and velocity, and can be mapped to almost any parameter within VPS Avenger, for creating exciting effects such as sidechain simulations, rhythmic gates and dynamic filter movements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the dedicated built-in drum sequencer, you can programme your own drum patterns up to 16 bars with ease. VPS Avenger comes packed with samples that make up more than 160 drum kits from all possible genres, with each kit holding 12 perfectly mixed and matched drum samples.

With four analog oscillators, multiple filters and envelopes, and built-in audio effects, Vacuum Pro lets you dive deep into subtractive synthesis to recreate those sought-after analog sounds from the 70s and 80s. Tweak the switches, knobs, and dials to program anything from basses, leads, pads, or unique sound effects. For even more warmth, Vacuum Pro has six virtual vacuum tube circuits that add crunch and grit at every stage of the signal path. Analog just got a whole lot warmer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Vintage Vibes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vacuum Pro is a powerful combination of two separate synthesizer parts that can be stacked, split, and layered to produce big, wide, and fat analog sounds. Each Vacuum Pro part starts with two wide-range, vacuum tube oscillators that can be synched, detuned, and set to various octave levels. Plus, Quad Detune controls per oscillator make it easy to quickly dial in lush sounds. For an even bigger sound, the built-in Doubling effect instantly widens and thickens up your patch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shape your sound with two vacuum tube filters that include a traditional low-pass filter and a selectable high-pass/band-pass filter. Vacuum Pro also has four envelope generators, matrix-assignable modulation, and a tempo sync’d LFO. The mixer offers a drive circuit and a tone-warping ring modulator. For authentic analog behavior, the Age controls let you manipulate the drift of and add dust to your sounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Programming Powerhouse</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vacuum Pro comes complete with 350+ tweakable patches created by acclaimed sound designers Richard Devine and Mark Ovenden. You can load these patches separately into each Vacuum Pro part to combine and experiment with multi-timbral sounds. For instant sound inspiration, Vacuum Pro features Smart Sound Randomization, which randomly generates new settings for either part or both. Define which modules you want to lock at their current settings, which will be randomized, and then let Smart Sound dial in a patch for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Global Control</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vacuum Pro’s Smart page condenses all the individual parameter controls into eight macro knobs that enable you to quickly shape the sound of your patch without extensive tweaking. Macro knobs such as Punch, Emphasis, and Complexity add an intuitive workflow for perfecting your programming. Switch back and forth between the micro and macro modes to quickly edit or create your own custom sounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Extra Effects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to its authentic analog sound, Vacuum Pro includes a host of creative tools that are characteristic of classic analog synthesizers. An onboard arpeggiator, which can be tempo sync’d to your DAW, offers a quick way to build melodic runs and short sequences. A built-in chorus/phaser and delay effects give life and motion to your Vacuum Pro patches. Onscreen pitch bend and modulation wheels add extra expression to any performance, and all parameters are MIDI-mappable for performance ease and automated control.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Features:</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A four-oscillator polyphonic analog synthesizer with vacuum tube circuit modeling.</li>\r\n\t<li>Super-wide, fat, and organic analog sound captures the character of classic synthesizers.</li>\r\n\t<li>Two individual synthesizer parts for huge, stacked sounds.</li>\r\n\t<li>350+ tweakable patches programmed by legendary sound designers.</li>\r\n\t<li>Smart Sound Randomizer dials in settings to user-defined parameters.</li>\r\n\t<li>8 Smart Knobs for easy programming and macro control over key parameters.</li>\r\n\t<li>Economy mode reduces the load on the host processor with minimal impact on the sound.</li>\r\n\t<li>64-bit plugin: VST, AU, RTAS, and AAX formats.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>System Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PC: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Windows 10, 8 or Windows 7 Service Pack 1</li>\r\n\t<li>Minimum Dual Core 2GHz (Intel Core i5 or i7 Recommended)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mac: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Mac OS X 10.8.5 - macOS 11 Big Sur <strong>(Full Apple silicon (M1) support is not available, but the VST plugin may be compatible with some DAWs if run using Rosetta)</strong>\n</li>\r\n\t<li>Core Duo Processor (Core i5 or i7 Recommended)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Plugin Formats</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>VST (32 bit and 64 bit) qualified for:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Ableton Live, Cubase, VIP, MPC</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>AU (64 bit only) qualified for:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Logic Pro X</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>AAX qualified for:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>ProTools 11+ (64 bit)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>RTAS qualified for:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>32-bit ProTools</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Please Note:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Minimum RAM 4GB (8GB or more recommended)</li>\r\n\t<li>1GB free hard drive space (Download and Installation)</li>\r\n\t<li>Internet Access (Download and Authorization)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>"}

Wave Sequence Synthesizer Wavestation</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Released in 1990, the WAVESTATION is a synthesizer with an advanced vector synthesis system that could create new sounds by combining and connecting multiple waveforms. Using unique features such as using a joystick to mix and morph four oscillators, a wave sequence function that could arrange waveforms in sequences to form rhythm or melody sequences patterns, it continues to be a legendary and irreplaceable instrument to this day,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The KORG Collection WAVESTATION V2 is an upgrade of the WAVESTATION software from 2004 and has been refined for modern production environments. KORG have added the much requested high-resolution and scalable interface. The preset sounds include all 1,500 programs, including those from the expansion ROM cards, giving the famous WAVESTATION sounds through the latest software as a plug-in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A Complete Reproduction of the Advanced Vector Synthesis System</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The WAVESTATION was the first synthesizer that enabled wave sequencing. A wave sequence cross-fades a variety of waveforms, smoothly connecting these waveforms to let you play them. The WAVESTATION differs most greatly from other synthesizers in how it lets you freely design and play wave sequences. When you create a patch using multiple oscillators, the WAVESTATION lets you use vector synthesis to freely configure how the sound is modulated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the KORG Collection WAVESTATION providing the sounds from all PCM memories of the WAVESTATION. The new iWAVESTATION also reproduces in software every detail of each parameter. For the hardware, KORG analyzed the circuit diagrams of the original design, and completely replicated the circuitry in software down to the last detail. Engineers with an exhaustive knowledge of the WAVESTATION made careful adjustments in order to obtain the sound of the original instrument, something that cannot be obtained simply by sampling the original sounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>High-Resolution Interface for Retina and 4K</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>KORG have made major GUI refinements to the KORG Legacy Collection WAVESTATION software released in 2004.

The KORG Collection WAVESTATION comes with extensive preset programs and waveforms from all models of the series: WAVESTATION, WAVESTATION EX, WAVESTATION A/D, and WAVESTATION SR. It also comes with 6 types of optional PCM/program cards that were popular at the time, and a total of 7 KLC cards are newly added to the KORG Legacy Collection.

This highly expressive instrument revolves around two channels of our exclusive Spectral Morphing Synthesis engine. Each channel features independent harmonic controls, individual filtering, and discrete LFO controls—including tempo-sync. Wobble 2 keeps things moving with an advanced pattern generator and onboard effects. This unparalleled combination delivers the swirling and undulating big-time grime that is the essence of Wobble 2. Even with all this control, the onscreen interface is clean and uncluttered; the well-defined controls deliver incredible sound-sculpting abilities, while providing immediate audio results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Turn and Learn</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the onscreen controls, Wobble 2 features a brilliant MIDI Learn Mode. Simply adjusting a parameter and then touching an external MIDI control creates a link between the two. This intuitive MIDI mapping system allows Wobble 2 to quickly integrate with your favorite MIDI hardware controller. In fact, Wobble 2 can save and recall your MIDI Learn presets and use them with any patch, so you only need to create them once.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wobbly Modulation Madness</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Wobble 2 pattern generator begins as a familiar step-sequencer, and rapidly escalates into an unbelievable tool for sonic creation. In addition to pitch and velocity, the pattern generator provides additional tabs for adding precise measured-step control of crucial sound creation parameters. Portamento can be selected for each step, as can the harmonic width and filter frequency of each Channel. LFO depth, rate, and sync can be defined per step. By automating even just one or two of these tempo-locked parameters, Wobble 2 can create some of the most insane sounds you've ever heard, infused with awe-inspiring depth and motion. Pattern presets can also be saved, recalled, and quickly modified on demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Music in Motion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Onboard pro-grade chorus and reverb effects breathe new life into your sounds. In addition, the stereo delay allows either Channel 1, Channel 2—or both—to be synchronized to beat values of the current tempo, tying your sound, song, and effects together. And speaking of tempo, Wobble 2 uses the SONiVOX Intelligent Rhythm Control (IRC) to keep your playing in the pocket. Combining the IRC Resolution and IRC Gate adjusts incoming MIDI note data so your playing is accurately in-time, in real-time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Finders, Keepers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wobble 2 features an integrated patch browser that makes it easy to store, sort, and find exactly the sound you are looking for. Patch attributes such as Genre, Color, Character—and of course, Name—allow your sounds to be stored in a musically meaningful way, as opposed to just indexed as numbers. Any and all attributes can be removed or re-assigned as your sound collection grows. Best of all, Wobble 2 comes with hundreds of professionally programmed sounds to get you started. Each one can be endlessly tweaked and modified to rapidly build your customized Wobble 2 sound collection.

One was connected to the keyboard, and the other connected to the sequencer. And Peter Zinoviev also told us about a never released EMS prototype, the VCS 4: two linked VCS3! We mixed both concepts, then added a lot of modules inherited from the XILS 3 and XILS 4 were born !</p>\r\n\r\n<p>XILS 4 combines Two XILS 3 synthesizers, that interact in many ways. To understand the genesis of the XILS 3, a recreation of the famous EMS synthi synthesizer, we have to go back to 1969.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1969: The PIN MATRIX REVOLUTION (No More Cables Anywhere)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a modular synthesizer, you can connect any module to another one. Peter Zinovieff, the visionary synth Wizard, established with the EMS series a new way to connect modules: The Pin Matrix. Just plug a pin in the Matrix, and the connection is set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Advantages of these techniques were obvious, breathtaking: More inputs and outputs for each module. No more cables cluttering the synth panel. Easy to operate, easy to read, visualize, and build, your patch. No more roadies: The analog modular synthesizer suddenly became portable. Add to this the first Vector Synthesis experiments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The XILS 3-4 series offers the same advantages and even brings a lot more on the table. Let’s now see the different modules</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No synthesis can be done without a good filter: the XILS 4 offers two multimode filters that were modeled to reproduce the analog character of the old machine. <br>\r\nThe 18 and 24 db low-pass types can self-oscillate, and internal non linearities have been finely reproduced: It is faithful to the \"zero-delay\" behavior of real life to give you a big smile when sweeping it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The PIN MATRIXES: As we saw, modules have to be connected through patch areas called Pin Matrixes. <br>\r\nThe XILS 4 offers no less than 8 Pin Matrixes: 2* 256+256 points dedicated to the main audio synthesis, one for the trig connections and 4 for the sequencer connections (one for the modulation and one for the trig connections). Experts will spot at once that, in the 2 extended Matrixes, you can freely define some sources and destinations in the last two rows of lines and columns, like S&amp;H, or even Envelope Segments. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, yes, that means even more fun, and ultimate tweaking possibilities!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Matrix Synthesizer</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The core of the synthesis is based on the original audio modules:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Six oscillators grouped in Three pairs</li>\r\n\t<li>Hard synchronisation</li>\r\n\t<li>One Low pass filter with 12, 18 and 24 db slope  </li>\r\n\t<li>One spring reverb</li>\r\n\t<li>One Trapezoidal looping envelop</li>\r\n\t<li>One Polyphonic Ring Modulator</li>\r\n\t<li>One Noise generator</li>\r\n\t<li>Two output static filters</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/3133/content_xils32_synthmodules.jpg\" style=\"height:277px; width:400px\"></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Oscillators : Beyond the digital limitation, in a true analog emulation, as in all XILS-lab instruments, the freedom of the sound which one has in mind when listening to hardware analog synthesizers, the analog spirit  have been preserved. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>XILS 4 oscillators were modeled to reproduce as close as possible the original waveforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following figures compare the different waveforms of the original AKS model and those of the XILS 4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see, the raising front is sharp, but as the signal reaches its maximum, it becomes slower.

Under this strange name is hidden the heart of almost every electronic organ or strings machine built in the 70s/80's. A very clever concept to get 49 notes or more of polyphony without having to manage 49 or more stable oscillators, or the nightmare of having to tune them in those days! Only one square oscillator, oscillating at a very high frequency (the \"Top Octave\"), has to be designed and adjusted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This oscillator is then \"divided\" to provide the 12 standard tempered frequencies over 4 (or more) octaves. These frequencies are then used to build the waveform of each of the 49 or more available notes. As a result, all the notes are kept in phase, hence no drift between octaves (see the videos comparison between the hardware and the software)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another benefit is that there is only one single tuning circuit for the whole keyboard: all the notes are modulated in the same manner when you sue the envelope Glide (So it's a 'special Glide' here gain). This is a limitation which gave the very special and recognisable effect used by a lot of electronic music artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Two other consequences:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>First,  the attack is done after the summation of the notes. This means that after a note have been played the following notes will get the level reached by the first one. In other words, No polyphonic attacks in the original machine, but XILS-lab, thanks to the computer world, offers you the best of both worlds: monophonic OR polyphonic attacks. Also known as \"paraphonic\" !</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, all the filters settings are also done after the summation of the notes. The filters (Strings, Human Voices, Basses) are therefore monophonic, which lead to a whole new, or in this case ancient, way of playing techniques, with unique sonic results that can't be replicated by later polyphonic analogue synthesizers, which had one filter per voice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a side note: 49 voices of polyphony wouldn't be possible even on today's' computers if the 49 specific filters had to be polyphonic too (human voices are done with up to 14 filters, strings involve 7 filters, so up to 1029 filters would have to run simultaneously ...).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, as the real machine, the XILS 505 has monophonic filters.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>System Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mac</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>OSX 10.8 and later.</li>\r\n\t<li>VST, Audio Unit, AAX (32&amp;64 bits, native).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PC</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Windows 7,8 and 10.</li>\r\n\t<li>VST, AAX (32 &amp; 64 bits, native).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> The XILS 505 is not a stand-alone application, but a plug-in to be inserted into a music software application.</p>\r\n</div>"}

The sound itself is reliant on fully-analog, discrete circuits and a classic state-variable 2-pole filter. Some of the key features which have never been done before on this synth is a powerful unison mode, M/S Technology and the signature Brainworx Audio Tolerance Modeling Technology</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Full Analog Modelling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Original or otherwise, the acclaimed analog synthesizer’s sound now benefits from the ultimate upgrade. Thanks to Brainworx Audio ably boosting bx_oberhausen with full polyphony of up to 32 voices, twice the voice count of today’s priciest poly synths remaining resolutely in the analog domain, users can create sounds that are not possible using the original hardware!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Introducing TMT</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using Brainworx’s proprietary, patented Tolerance Modeling Technology to accurately replicate individual component variations specified by the manufacturer. This creates, in separate voices slight variations which you would expect to hear in an original analog instrument. With TMT each voice produces a slightly different sound including variations in frequencies and phases as well as frequency responses - exactly like an analog hardware would.These slight variations add the complexity, nuance, depth and width for which analog instruments are loved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Unison</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The voices can be combined to a powerful unison mode. When used with the unique TMT feature, Unison generates a rich, complex and analog sound unparalleled by any other virtual instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>M/S Technology</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Introducing an unheard feature to the world of synthesizers, this allows you to select which part of your sound passes through the filter section and which doesn't. Allowing for subtle effects like solid bass foundation as well as crazy stereo processing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Effect Section</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are not just effects. They took some of their best products and shrunk them into an effects rack that is proudly carrying the Brainworx brand. They also asked their partners at Mäag to add their infamous AIR BAND®. The signal chain in the effects section can easily be altered by a drag &amp; drop function.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Extensive Modulation Matrix</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The modulation matrix gives you a whole dimension of sound design possibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FM Included</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adding Frequency Modulation to an analog synth classic allows you to push the boundaries of creativity much further than the original synthesizers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Arpeggiator</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The arpeggiator comes with all the functions you would expect from it - including an adjustable \"swing\" parameter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In-Plugin Preset Management with NKS support</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The preset management system allows you to categorize your presets for easy retrieval.

Following the first generation microKORG, a number of variations were introduced, including the microKORG XL released in 2009 and the microKORG S with 2+1 speakers, as well as many color variations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The microKORG was born out of a desire to bring the appeal and fun of synthesizers to beginner and professional musicians, track makers, and creators everywhere. Korg easily achieved this goal,creating a wildly successful synthesizer that was not only compact andeasy to use but sounded amazing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To celebrate the 20th anniversary of its release, the original \"microKORG\" will be reintroduced as software: microKORG for Mac/Win.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"483\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8-mT8xoCTho\" title=\"microKORG VST Vocoder is AWESOME.... a tutorial\" width=\"859\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A Full-Fledged Synthesizer With a Modeled Analog Sound</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"microKORG for Mac/Win\" fully recreates the sound, behavior, and look of the original \"microKORG\". It reproduces not only the analog modeling oscillator, filter, and amp sections, but also the effects section and arpeggiator. The vocoder function, which was one of the main features of the original \"microKORG,\" has also been reproduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35790/original_1711c2c5969bfc672998cae005ed2ac9_pc.gif\" width=\"600\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Oscillator Section With a Variety of Waveforms.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the oscillator section, which is the basis of tone, two oscillators can be used per voice. Oscillator 1 has 8 built-in waveforms, including sawtooth wave, square wave, and audio input, and you can also select the DWGS waveform, which has 64 built-in waveforms. Each waveform can be processed with the two [CONTROL 1/2] knobs (DWGS is waveform selection only) for even more versatile sound creation. Oscillator 1 also has an oscilloscope that displays waveform changes in real time. Oscillator 2 contains only the basic waveforms of sawtooth, square, and triangle waves, and can also perform oscillator-to-oscillator modulation such as ring modulation, cross modulation, and hard sync.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35791/original_fb7baf20a1b2e4f32a90ff8e02a00ba3_pc.jpg\" width=\"600\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Filter Section for Processing Sounds, Amp Section That Controls the Volume.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sound from the oscillator goes through the mixer and then into the filter section. The filter section incorporates four types of filters, allowing the sound from the oscillator to be processed as desired. The low-pass filter also has a sharp 24dB mode.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After passing through the filter, the sound enters the amplifier section. Here you can adjust the overall volume as well as panning and key tracking. A distortion switch is also provided for extreme distortion of the sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35792/original_2485b3f0f6a237182f602b56b2f2ca7d_pc.jpg\" width=\"600\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>An Envelope That Controls the Temporal Variation of Sound.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The change from the beginning to the end of a sound can greatly change its character. For example, some sounds appear and disappear quickly, while others are heard slowly and have a long reverberating sound. Envelope generators are used to create such temporal changes in sound. microKORG for Mac/Win\" has one envelope for the filter and one for the amplifier. The envelope itself is an easy-to-understand ADSR 4-stage type. There is also a display on the envelope slider that shows the shape and progression of the envelope, making it even easier to understand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35793/original_e6af999fdee074407bb0b29b5c02f483_pc.jpg\" width=\"600\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lfo That Creates Periodic Changes in Sound.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two built-in low frequency oscillators (LFO) that can be used for vibrato, wah, tremolo, etc. LFO 1 offers sawtooth, square 1, triangle, and sample &amp; hold (random) waveforms, while LFO 2 has sawtooth, square 2, sine, and sample &amp; hold available for a total of four waveforms each. The KEY SYNC switch can also be used to turn waveform restart on/off during note on, LFO polyphonic operation, and so on. Of course, the LFO cycle can also be tempo-synchronized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35794/original_c19480e12d851d320203f6439978e69e_pc.jpg\" width=\"600\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Virtual Patching for Exploring Deep Sound Creation.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An additional fun aspect of sound creation is modulation, in which sections of the synthesizer are connected to each other to change their behavior. Like the original \"microKORG\", \"microKORG for Mac/Win\" allows you to set up four modulation routings (modulation connections). 8 different modulation sources and destinations can be connected to each other, and the modulation depth can be set. By connecting 8 different modulation sources and destinations, you can immerse yourself in a world of even deeper sound creation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Vocoder With a Wide Variety of Functions.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The vocoder function synthesizes the sound input to AUDIO IN and the sound of Oscillator 1 to create the effect of speaking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Important note:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please note that the following DAWs do not support the Vocoder feature at this time:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>FL Studio</li>\r\n\t<li>Studio One</li>\r\n\t<li>Garage Band</li>\r\n\t<li>Komplete Kontrol</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35795/original_6ef516d6858afa70fb0db31f55bae5c7_pc.jpg\" width=\"600\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The vocoder function of \"microKORG for Mac/Win\" consists of 8 bands (2 out of 16 bands in a set), and it not only produces the vocoder sounds of the past, but also allows you to adjust the filter frequency, modulate, shift the entire filter bank up and down, and adjust the level and panning of each band to create your own unique vocoder sound. The level and panning of each band can also be adjusted to create unique vocoder sounds. Also, by clicking the HOLD button, you can record the formant of the input audio and use it as the sound source. In addition, the level of each band of the input voice and the level and panning of each band of the vocoder itself are displayed graphically, providing an easy-to-understand operation system that can only be achieved with software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35796/original_37a6af33a3b50140515e125ea7da62df_pc.jpg\" width=\"600\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Flexible and Fun Arpeggiator.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The arpeggiator can be used in both synth mode and vocoder mode. When a chord is played, its component notes are played one by one in sequence to create a dispersed chord. The arpeggiator has six built-in patterns, including up, down, random, and triggered patterns, and a variety of arpeggio patterns can be created by setting the octave range, resolution, and number of steps. The step can also be switched on and off, allowing you to freely change the rhythm of the arpeggio. In addition, in synth mode, you can also select the timbres that play the arpeggio, so when two tones are layered, the arpeggio can be overlaid on a pad tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35797/original_dc5345442dddcd7eef90998b392c5368_pc.jpg\" width=\"600\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Effects Section With 2 Effects and EQ</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with the original \"microKORG,\" the effects section has two units: modulation effects and delays. The modulation system has three types: flanger/chorus, ensemble, and phaser, while the delay has three built-in types: stereo, cross, and L/R. The EQ is also 2-band with variable frequency, useful for finalizing the sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GUI That Pursues the Ease of Use With All the Benefits That Software Provides.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"microKORG for Mac/Win\" retains the appearance of the original \"microKORG\" while adopting a graphical user interface designed for ease of use as software. While the original version used two rotary switches and five knobs for editing operations, the software version displays all parameters and allows the user to see the various overall tone settings. Each section also has additional convenient and easy-to-use functions unique to the software. For example, oscillator 1 has an oscilloscope that displays the waveform of the sound being played as well as the waveform of the selected waveform, the CONTROL knob displays the parameter name and its value in a tooltip, and the two envelopes have displays that allow you to visually check the shape and progress of the envelopes. The various settings of the arpeggiator, LFO waveforms, and virtual patches are also displayed, allowing you to see everything at a glance. In vocoder mode, there is a built-in display that shows the oscilloscope display of the audio input, as well as the level and panning of each band, and the band-specific level of the input audio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The number of voices has been greatly expanded to a maximum of 64 voices, and the 2-timbre layered tones are even easier to use than the original.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35798/original_49c0534ab456bfd80b40e621d5c26082_pc.jpg\" width=\"600\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nA total of 192 built-in programs are available for the original \"microKORG\" and \"microKORG S\".

{"title": "modwave native", "brand": "KORG", "url": "/product/1-Instruments/4-Synth/11222-modwave-native", "rating": 5.0, "description": "<div itemprop=\"description\"><h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Synthesis Powerhouse With Distinctive Wavetable Timbres, Kaoss Physics, and Motion Sequencing 2.0</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1985, Korg’s DW-8000 combined digital wavetables with rich analog filters to give users sounds which were impossible to create with analog oscillators. It’s still a cult favorite today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The modwave, released in 2021, builds on the DW legacy and transforms it into a modern monster synth, featuring incredibly deep wavetable oscillators, gorgeous filters, wildly flexible modulation, sophisticated pattern sequencing, and macro controls to deliver unique, powerful, and easily customizable sounds and phrases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, Korg is pleased to announce modwave native, the fully-compatible software counterpart to the hardware modwave synthesizer. modwave native is available in VST3, AAX, and standalone formats on both macOS and Windows, as well as AU on macOS. You can seamlessly exchange sounds between hardware and software. Produce in your DAW with modwave native, and then play the same sounds on stage using the modwave hardware. Create sounds with the hardware’s hands-on interface, and then share them with a computer-based collaborator. Plus, you can use any of the many third-party sound libraries available for the hardware modwave, as well as sample libraries designed for either the modwave or wavestate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Modwave Synthesis Engine</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>KORG are not kidding when they call the wavetable oscillators \"deep\". Start with over 200 wavetables, each containing up to 64 waveforms—from thousands of individual waves. Use the 30+ Modifiers to change their basic character, and the 13 Morph Types to process them in real-time. Create new hybrids from any two wavetables using the unique, realtime A/B Blend. Quick math: that's over 230 million wavetable variations out of the box, and that’s before you even add modulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No need to stop there, though! Expand your palette even more by importing new wavetables. Try the many free and commercial wavetable libraries in the standard Serum format*, or create your own using the free, cross-platform WaveEdit, available in a custom version for the modwave. Layer wavetables with samples from the built-in, multi-gigabyte PCM library, import your own samples using Korg’s Sample Builder software, or load samples from the growing number of third-party libraries for wavestate and modwave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* If an imported wavetable has more than 64 waveforms, it is assumed to be a generated crossfade, and some of the intermediate waveforms are dropped to create a 64-waveform version.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each Program has two full-featured wavetable oscillators, plus a sub oscillator/noise generator and any of a dozen stereo filter types, including the aggressive MS-20, sweet Polysix, and the newly enhanced Multi Filter. Animate almost any parameter using the massively flexible modulation system, with four triggerable envelopes, five LFOs, dual mod processors and two key-track generators–plus multi-lane Motion Sequencing and Kaoss Physics. Layer two Programs together for double the possibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35821/original_fdb71224de442c40008943cadd7bf91e_pc.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 330px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Kaoss Physics</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaoss Physics models a ball rolling on a surface and/or bouncing off walls. \"Throw\" the ball with a gesture on your mouse or trackpad, or launch the ball automatically using a trigger source such as Gate + Damper. You can also directly control the ball by dragging without releasing. Use DAW automation to record both gestures and direct control. The position of the ball produces four modulation signals, which can be used to control any modulation destination you like: the X and Y locations, the distance from the center, and the angle relative to the X axis. The result is an interactive controller that amplifies your physical gestures, transforming them into captivating, complex, and evolving musical results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a bump in the virtual surface, going either down or up, like a valley or a hill. You can set the height or depth of the bump, and choose one of several different shapes for its slopes. The surface has adjustable friction, so that the ball slows down as it travels. There are walls on the four sides of the surface, and when the ball hits a wall, it bounces off. Walls can slow down the ball, as if they were padded, or accelerate the ball, like bumpers in a pinball machine. The walls can also be removed entirely, so that the surface wraps around to the opposite edges like a vintage arcade game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The modeled environment can create specific modulation effects. For instance, use a centered bump with negative height so that the modulation values always eventually return to 0. Or, position a bump with positive height on a side or a corner, to push modulation values away from that zone</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most parameters, including Tilt, Friction, Time, Bump Height and Position, etc. are modulatable. You can even modulate them from the Kaoss Physics outputs—for instance, try modulating Tilt X with Kaoss Y.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Motion Sequencing 2.0</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Motion Sequencing 2.0 is evolved from the wavestate’s Wave Sequencing 2.0. Timing, Pitch, Shape, and four sets of Step Sequence values are separated into “Lanes,” each with their own loop start and loop end, adding a deeper, more customizable level of phrase and modulation recording.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every time the sequence moves forward, the individual Lanes are combined to create the output. For instance, a step sequence value may be matched with a different duration, pitch, and shape every time that it plays. You can modulate each Lane’s loop points separately for every note, using velocity, LFOs, envelopes, Mod Knobs, or other controllers. Each note in a chord can be playing something different!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lanes can also randomize the step order every time they play. Finally, individual steps can be randomly skipped, with a modulatable probability from 0 to 100%. The result is organic, ever-changing sounds that respond to your control. The dual arpeggiators can interact with Motion Sequences for even more possibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35822/original_831ed10dc409b235a0015c262cac2783_pc.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 432px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What’s a Wavetable?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wavetables are sets of single-cycle digital waveforms, arranged in a specific order. The wavetable's \"position\" determines which waveform is played. Moving the position with an envelope, LFO, or other modulation source creates subtle or dramatic changes in timbre. Some wavetable systems switch abruptly from one waveform to another; others crossfade smoothly between them. The modwave can do either one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Modifiers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use over 30 Modifiers to alter the character of any wavetable at load time. For instance, isolate the odd or even harmonics, add weight through anti-aliased quantization or saturation, or revisit the gritty character of old-school wavetable synths with the Vintage 8 &amp; 12 options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Morph</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 13 Morph Types let you stretch, squeeze, reflect, and otherwise alter the wavetables in real-time, changing their timbre and—when modulated—creating additional motion in the sound. Sync creates classic swept-sync timbres, using only a single oscillator. Three special Morph Types—FM, AM, and Ring Mod—modulate Osc 2 with Osc 1, and the last two even apply to samples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A/B Blend</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using the unique A/B mode, oscillators can blend any two wavetables with phase-synchronous precision—different from simply layering voices—opening up a dimension of intermediate waveforms. Add body to otherwise \"thin\" waveforms, for instance, or a touch of sizzle to a mellow timbre. Even fade between two different \"modifier\" versions of the same wavetable. A/B Blend can be modulated in real-time, of course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Gigabytes of Samples</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wavetables also sound great when layered with samples, and the modwave oscillators handle that with aplomb, using KORG’s proprietary anti-aliasing sample playback technology. Totaling in the gigabytes, the modwave’s sample library includes new material from KORG, Airwave, and Francis Preve, plus a bank from Plugin Guru and a selection from the Kronos and Krome libraries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>User Sample Banks let you add more Multisamples to the system. You can create your own Banks, or use Banks from third party sound developers. modwave native can load many User Sample Banks simultaneously. This is one area in which software has the edge, due to the large amount of storage and RAM available on your computer: the hardware modwave can load only one User Sample Bank at a time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Filters for Days</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Add vintage character to your sounds with the aggressive MS-20 Lowpass or Highpass filters, or the strong, sweet Polysix Lowpass - all newly enhanced with gain controls to make it easier to dial in the resonance timbre. Shape and refine with a full collection of resonant 2-pole and 4-pole Lowpass, Highpass, Bandpass, and Band Reject filters. Or, step outside the box with KORG’s unique Multi Filter, which creates modulatable blends of multiple modes simultaneously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Astonishingly Flexible Modulation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bursting with modulation sources and destinations, the modwave invites you to explore. Most parameters can be modulated, with more than a thousand modulation destinations per Performance, and no fixed limit on the total number of modulation routings. You can even modulate settings for individual Motion Sequence Steps! Each modulation routing includes a primary modulation source, an intensity, and a secondary modulation source; the three are multiplied together to create the modulation amount. A single destination, such as Filter Cutoff, can have up to 31 incoming modulation routings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mod Knobs put macro transformations under your fingertips, making it easy to explore the sonic worlds inside each Performance. Tweaking an existing sound? Quickly identify modulation sources using real-time displays of all envelopes, LFOs, and other primary modulation sources. Easily create modulation routings using drag-and-drop, and get an overview of all routings via the Mod List. Mod Processors let you transform modulation signals using quantization, smoothing, curvature, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>An Arsenal of Effects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The modwave’s superb effects deliver production-ready sounds. Each Layer has three dedicated effects, plus a send to the Performance's master reverb, followed by a master parametric EQ. Along with standards such as compressors, EQs, choruses, flangers, phasers, and stereo delays, you’ll find distinctive processors such as the Wave Shaper, Talking Modulator, Reverse Delay, Multiband Mod Delay, and Overb (from the OASYS and Kronos), plus modeled effects including VOX guitar amps, VOX wah, multi-head tape echo, and a collection of classic guitar pedals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Randomization That Inspires</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking for even more inspiration? The “dice” icon at the top of the window generates new sounds via intelligent randomization. Randomize the entire sound or just a part of it, such as the oscillators, filter, or effects. Use the results directly, or as a jumping-off point for your own creations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Set Lists and Smooth Sound Transitions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Set Lists offer effortless organization of your modwave Performances, and deliver instant access at the gig or in rehearsal. Smooth Sound Transitions allow previously-played voices and effects to continue to ring out naturally, even once a new sound has been selected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Designed by KORG R&amp;D in California</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>KORG R&amp;D created the wavestate and the original Wavestation, co-created the OASYS and Kronos, and has developed fundamental technologies behind many other KORG instruments. The modwave reflects their unique aesthetic, delivering stunning sound, deep flexibility, and immediate physical control via cutting-edge technologies. Key sound designers from the wavestate, Airwave and Peter “Ski” Schwartz, joined Francis Preve, Richard Devine, and the Korg voicing team to create the modwave’s incredible sound library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Patch Exchange Between Modwave and Modwave Native</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sounds created with modwave or modwave native can be used interchangeably, transcending hardware and software boundaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To import and export sounds, use the Librarian page in modewave native, and the modwave Sound Editor/Librarian for the modwave hardware.

Organic, Inspirational, and Mind-Blowingly Powerful.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>KORG’s legendary Wavestation introduced the world to Wave Sequencing, transforming raw samples into sounds that no-one had ever heard before. The flagship OASYS and KRONOS keyboards developed Wave Sequencing even further, expanding on its unique palette of lush, evolving pads and driving rhythms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2020, the acclaimed wavestate brought Wave Sequencing to the next level. Featuring the radically re-imagined Wave Sequencing 2.0, the wavestate delivers astonishing, ever-changing sounds with extensive hands-on control. Far from a nostalgic reissue, the wavestate is designed from the ground up for a new generation of musicians, producers, and composers, taking cues from sources as diverse as modular synths, groove boxes, and algorithmic composition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, Korg is proud to present wavestate native, the fully-compatible software counterpart to the hardware wavestate synthesizer. wavestate native is available in VST3, AAX, and standalone formats on both macOS and Windows, as well as AU on macOS. You can seamlessly exchange sounds between hardware and software. Produce in your DAW with wavestate native, and then play the same sounds onstage using the wavestate hardware. Create sounds with the hardware’s hands-on interface, and then share them with a computer-based collaborator.

What if they could evolve in organic, unexpected ways, instead of just repeating?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wave Sequencing 2.0 splits apart the timing, the sequence of samples, and the melody, so that each can be manipulated independently. Also added are new characteristics including shapes, gate times, and step sequencer values. Each of these is a “Lane,” and each Lane can have a different number of steps and its own start, end, and loop points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every time the sequence moves forward, the individual Lanes are combined to create the output. For instance, a sample may be matched with a different duration, pitch, shape, gate length, and step sequence value every time that it plays. You can modulate each Lane’s start, end, and loop points separately for every note, using velocity, LFOs, envelopes, Mod Knobs, or other controllers. Each note in a chord can be playing something different!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lanes can also randomize the step order every time they play, with realtime control over the range of included steps. Finally, individual steps can be randomly skipped, with a modulatable probability from 0 to 100%. The result is organic, ever-changing sounds that respond to your control. The four built-in arpeggiators can interact with Wave Sequences for even more possibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35813/original_2e536919bee869a8a624e2da82dc7eb4_pc.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 432px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Easily Expressive. Exceptionally Deep.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bursting with modulation sources and destinations, the wavestate invites you to explore. Most parameters can be modulated, with up to 4,000 modulation destinations per Performance, and no fixed limit on the total number of modulation routings. You can even modulate settings for individual Wave Sequence Steps! Each modulation routing includes a primary modulation source, an intensity, and a secondary modulation source; the three are multiplied together to create the modulation amount. A single destination, such as Filter Cutoff, can have up to 31 incoming modulation routings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mod Knobs put macro transformations under your fingertips, making it easy to explore the sonic worlds inside each Performance. Tweaking an existing sound? Quickly identify modulation sources using real-time displays of all envelopes, LFOs, and other primary modulation sources. Easily create modulation routings using drag-and-drop, and get an overview of all routings via the Mod List. Mod Processors let you transform modulation signals using quantization, smoothing, curvature, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Randomization That Inspires.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking for even more inspiration? The “dice” icon at the top of the window generates new sounds via intelligent randomization. Randomize the entire sound or just a part of it, such as the filter, the Sample Lane, or the effects. Use the results directly, or as a jumping-off point for your own creations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>An Arsenal of Effects.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wavestate’s superb effects deliver production-ready sounds. Each Layer has three dedicated effects; additionally, the Performance has a master reverb and parametric EQ. Along with standards such as compressors, EQs, choruses, flangers, phasers, and stereo delays, you’ll find distinctive processors such as the Wave Shaper, Talking Modulator, Reverse Delay, Multiband Mod Delay, and Overb (from the OASYS), plus modeled effects including VOX guitar amps, VOX wah, multi-head tape echo, and a collection of classic guitar pedals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Choose Your Filter.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Add vintage character to your sounds with the aggressive MS-20 Lowpass or Highpass filters, or the strong, sweet Polysix Lowpass. Shape and refine with a full collection of resonant 2-pole and 4-pole Lowpass, Highpass, Bandpass, and Band Reject filters. Or, step outside the box with Korg’s unique Multi Filter, which creates modulatable blends of multiple modes simultaneously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ample Samples. 64 Stereo Voices.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Totaling in the gigabytes, the wavestate’s sample library is more than a thousand times larger than that of the original Wavestation. That’s a lot of great-sounding raw material for Wave Sequences. There’s a bank of samples from Plugin Guru, new samples from KORG, and a selection from the Kronos and Krome libraries. Of course, KORG also provides all of the Wavestation’s samples (including all options), plus a huge library of Wavestation Wave Sequences. Naturally, you can also load your own samples using Korg's Sample Builder - the same format as the hardware wavestate and modwave. Play up to 64 stereo voices with pristine clarity, using KORG’s proprietary anti-aliasing sample playback technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Multiply by Four.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For even more rich and complex results, layer up to four Programs together in a Performance–each with their own effects and arpeggiator. The Vector Envelope and Joystick mix the individual voices of the four Layers, and can also modulate any other parameters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Set Lists and Smooth Sound Transitions.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Set Lists offer effortless organization of your wavestate Performances, and deliver instant access at the gig or in rehearsal. Smooth Sound Transitions allow previously-played voices and effects to continue to ring out naturally, even once a new sound has been selected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.pluginboutique.com/ckeditor_assets/pictures/35814/original_2f8dc492c193cd5ffc496aa41f3fb10a_pc.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 333px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Designed by KORG R&amp;D in California.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>KORG R&amp;D created the original Wavestation, co-created the OASYS and Kronos, and has developed fundamental technologies behind many other KORG instruments. wavestate native reflects their unique aesthetic, delivering stunning sound and deep flexibility via cutting-edge technologies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three of the key sound designers from the original Wavestation, John Bowen, John “Skippy” Lehmkuhl (Plugin Guru), and Peter “Ski” Schwartz, joined Belgian artist Airwave and the renowned KORG voicing team to create the incredible wavestate sound library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Patch Exchange Between Wavestate and Wavestate Native.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sounds created with wavestate or wavestate native can be used in common with each other, transcending hardware and software boundaries and allowing the sounds to be enjoyed in a variety of environments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sound exchange is done via the wavestate Sound Editor/Librarian.
